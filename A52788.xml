            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Book preſents Thee with the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Life &amp; Death of</hi> POMPONIUS AT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICUS, and the various Concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Revolutions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the <hi>Roman</hi> State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his time; and the wiſe Methods which that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man uſed to preſerve the <hi>Honour, Innocence</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of his Perſon from the Dangers that might occur by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93854:3"/>
Two Things I muſt caution thee in reading hereof;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Concerning the Perſon and Practice of <hi>Atticus.</hi> Many things in him are worthy of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; his <hi>Prudence, Learning, Beneficence, Compaſſion;</hi> his great <hi>Care</hi> to avoid engaging in any of thoſe Factions that gave thoſe great Diſturbances to the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>But ſome things were ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to his Perſon, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Circumſtances, and the Manners and Occurrences of that State wherein he lived, that are hardly to be match'd in any other Perſon, and therefore may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in theſe reſpects rather give matter of admiration of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than matter of imitation
<pb facs="tcp:93854:3"/>
of ſome of the Tranſactions of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in the time of <hi>Atticus,</hi> was the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre</hi> whereupon the Heads of the ſeveral Parties and Factions acted their parts, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of that State, whereof ſome Account is hereafter given.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms, States</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> are in themſelves very various, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes much more various in the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that attend them; as the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of their <hi>Officers,</hi> their different <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements,</hi> their publick <hi>Concerns</hi> with other Nations, and infinite more: ſo that it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that two <hi>States</hi> may in all things exactly match one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb facs="tcp:93854:4"/>
whereby it comes to paſs that ſome <hi>Kingdoms, States</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths</hi> are more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Publick Evils; eſpecially that of the <hi>Colliſion</hi> of <hi>Factions</hi> than others.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Governments</hi> (eſpecially that of this Kingdom of <hi>England)</hi> are ſo wiſely conſtituted, and ſo firmly eſtabliſhed and fixed by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> that in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, they are not much obnoxious to ſuch Factions: But if ſuch at any time ſhould happen, yet they are quickly compoſed, or effectually ſuppreſſed, or languiſh and die of themſelves in a little time: But the State of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was ſcarce poſſible for them to be long without ſuch Storms and Commotions by great
<pb facs="tcp:93854:4"/>
Factions ariſing therein; as is hereafter ſhewn.</p>
            <p>That therefore which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this Book, was not written in relation to any <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>State</hi> on this ſide <hi>Rome,</hi> nor even to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, otherwiſe than it ſtood under thoſe Circumſtances of thoſe Factions that were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent therein about the time of <hi>Atticus</hi> his Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore read this Book with its due application to the <hi>Roman</hi> State; and to that State as it was in at that time of thoſe Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and as if thou hadſt been a Spectator of the Scene where thoſe Tragedies were acted, and then thou anſwereſt the intention of the Writer; and poſſibly this Pamphlet may give thee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent diverſion of an hour, and in
<pb facs="tcp:93854:5"/>
ſome meaſure give thee an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, and the reaſon of the Occurrences that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein in and near the time of the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> though it be by no means applicable to the <hi>Kingdom, State</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou liveſt.</p>
            <p>If thou find the Tranſlation of the Life of <hi>Atticus</hi> not to run ſo ſmoothly as could be wiſhed, I have this Excuſe for it, that as near as I can, I have in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation purſued the Letter of the <hi>Original;</hi> which, by reaſon of the difference of <hi>Idioms</hi> in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will not allow that Elegance to the Tranſlation, as it is to be found in the <hi>Original.</hi> In the Equation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Money with the value of Ours,
<pb facs="tcp:93854:5"/>
I may in ſome places be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becauſe of the diſcrepance between them; but this may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be rectified by the Reader, and is not of any great conſequence to the <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> The <hi>Errata</hi> of the Preſs are inſerted at the End of the Book, together with ſome few <hi>Addenda.</hi>

Moreover, in this young youth, beſides his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wit, there was a certain ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Elocution and Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did not only readily learn what was taught him, but did alſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce it: By which means, even in his youth, he became eminent among his equals, and ſhone forth with greater luſtre than his generous fellow-Scholars could bear with an equal mind. He therefore by his ſtudy prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on others; Among whom were <hi>P. Torquatus, C. Marius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Caius,</hi> and <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> all whom by his converſation, he ſo obliged unto him, that none was dearer to them than he. His Father died early. And <hi>Pomponius</hi> being then but a very young man, was not without ſome danger, by reaſon of the aſſinity of <hi>P. Sulpitius,</hi> who was ſlain being Tribune of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For <hi>Amicia</hi> the Neece of <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93854:9"/>
married <hi>Servius Sulpitius,</hi> Brother of <hi>P. Sulpitius. P. Sulpitius</hi> therefore being thus ſlain, as ſoon as <hi>Pomponius</hi> obſerved that the City was diſturbed by the Tumult of <hi>Cinna,</hi> neither could he have liberty of living according to his Rank, but that he ſhould offend one Party; the minds of the Citizens being disjointed, while ſome favoured the party of <hi>Sylla,</hi> others the party of <hi>Cinna.</hi> Concluding it therefore a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time to addict himſelf to his Studies, he went to <hi>Athens,</hi> and yet neverthleſs helped with his wealth young <hi>Marius,</hi> then declared a publick Enemy; whoſe flight he aſſiſted with his Money. And leſt this his journey ſhould bring ſome detriment to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he removed thither a great part of his wealth. He ſo lived at <hi>Athens,</hi> that he became deſervedly moſt dear to the <hi>Athenians:</hi> For beſides that great Grace which appeared in him, being then but young, he oftentimes relieved their publick wants with his own Wealth. For whereas here was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of publick <hi>Verſura,</hi> taking up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93854:10"/>
money at leſs intereſt, and to put it out at greater; neither had they any equal conditions in the doing thereof; he ever interpoſed, and in ſuch a manner that he never received any uſury from them, nor ſuffered his money to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer in their hands than the time appointed; both which were of great advantage to them: For hereby he did neither ſuffer their debts to grow ſtale by indulgence, nor to grow greater by the running on of uſury. Alſo he added to this friendlineſs by another li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality: He gave Corn to all, ſo that to each perſon were given ſix meaſures of Wheat, which kind of meaſure at <hi>Athens,</hi> is called <hi>Medimnus</hi> (ſomething more than our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Buſhel) he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſo, that he ſeemed common to the loweſt, and yet equal to the chiefeſt; whereby it came to paſs that they publickly heaped upon him all the honours they could; endeavouring to make him a free Citizen of that City; which yet he refuſed (which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret becauſe the liberty of a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> would be loſt by becoming the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93854:10"/>
Citizen of another City.) As long as he was there, he oppoſed the ſetting up of any Statue for him; but could not hinder it after his departure; therefore they placed ſome for him and <hi>Pilia</hi> (his Wife) in their moſt ſacred places; for in all the buſineſſes of the Republick they had him their Actor and their Author.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was firſt the bounty of his Fortune, that he was born in that City wherein was the Palace of the Empire of the World, whereby he had the ſame for his Countrey and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs. But it was the evidence of his prudence, that when he came into that City that excelled all other in in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, Humanity and Learning, he became moſt dear unto it above all others.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sylla</hi> came hither, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as long as he was there, he kept <hi>Pomponius</hi> with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with the Humanity and Learning of the young man; for he ſpake <hi>Greek</hi> ſo well, that he ſeemed born at <hi>Athens.</hi> But ſo great was his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93854:11"/>
ſweetneſs in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, that there appeared to be in him a certain native grace, and not acquired. He pronouced Poems in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> ſo that nothing could be done better: By which means it came to paſs, that <hi>Sylla</hi> would never let him go from him, &amp; deſired to carry him along with him. To whom, when he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſwade him, <hi>Pomponius</hi> ſaid, I pray thee do not deſire to lead me againſt thoſe (with whom, leſt I ſhould bear arms againſt thee) I left <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Sylla</hi> commending the kindneſs of the young man, departing from <hi>Athens,</hi> commanded that all the Preſents which he had there received, ſhould be delivered to <hi>Pomponius.</hi> Here living many years, he employed ſo much of his endeavors for the affairs of his Family, as he became a diligent Father of a Family, and allowed all the reſt of his time either to Learning, or the affairs of the Commonwealth of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> yet nevertheleſs he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all civil offices to his Friends. For he came to their Aſſemblies, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93854:11"/>
if any great buſineſs was in action, he was not wanting: He yielded a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fidelity to <hi>Cicero</hi> in all his dangers; To whom, flying from his Countrey, he gave 250000 <hi>Seſtertia</hi> (two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eighty three pounds ſix ſhillings eight pence) but the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeaſed, he returned to <hi>Rome, L. Cotta</hi> and <hi>L. Torquatus</hi> being (as I think) Conſuls. Which day the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> ſo entertained, that by their Tears they ſhewed their ſorrow for their future loſs. He had an Unkle, <hi>Q. Caecilius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, and a friend of <hi>L. Lucullus,</hi> rich, of a nature hard to be pleaſed; whoſe frowardneſs he ſo weathered, that he kept, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, the good will of that man, to his extreameſt old age, whom no other could patiently bear; by which means he gain'd the fruit of his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances: For <hi>Caecilius</hi> dying, by his Will adopted him, and made him his Heir of three fourth Parts of all he had; out of which inheritance, he received <hi>centies</hi> LLS. (or to the value of 300000 Crowns according to ſome;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93854:12"/>
or 83360 <hi>lib.</hi> according to others.) His Siſter was married to <hi>Q. Tullius Cicero;</hi> which Match <hi>M. Tullius Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> brought about; with whom, being his School-fellow, he lived moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and much more familiarly than with <hi>Quintius:</hi> whereby it appeared, that in Friendſhip Likeneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was far more prevalent than Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He uſed <hi>Q. Hortenſius</hi> very intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (who in thoſe times obtained the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Eloquence) ſo that it was hard to underſtand who loved him beſt, <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> And herein he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that which was of greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that between thoſe betwixt whom there was the greateſt emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of praiſe, there interceded no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and that he became the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uniter of them both. He carried himſelf ſo in the Commonwealth, that he always was, and was thought to be of the beſt party; yet he would not commit himſelf to the waves of Civil Diſſention; which he eſteemed to be no more in the power of him that ſhould deliver himſelf over to them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93854:12"/>
than if he had been toſſed on the waves of the Sea. He ſought not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, although they lay open to him; either by reaſon of his Favour or of his Dignity, becauſe they could neither be ſought according to the ancient uſe, nor taken up with due obſervance of the Laws, among thoſe exceſſive charges that accompanied ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, nor could they be born in the Commonwealth without danger, the manners of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> being very much corrupted.</p>
               <p>He never came to publick Sales, neither became he a publick Farmer of any thing, or a Surety thereof. He accuſed no man either by his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or by proxy. He never went to Law touching his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, nor had any Law-ſuits. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Prefectures of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulates and Praetors offered unto him, that he would follow none to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, being contented with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Offer, but deſpiſed the fruit of its private advantage; and would not go even with <hi>Q. Cicero</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:93854:13"/>
into <hi>Aſia,</hi> when he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the place of Legate with him. For he thought it became not him who would not be a Praetor, to become the follower of a Praetor. In which thing he did not only ſerve his own Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo his own Tranquillity; while he avoided the very ſuſpitions of offences: Whence it came to paſs, that his reſpect was the more valuable to all men, which they plainly ſaw was to be attributed to his kindneſs, and not to hope.</p>
               <p>The Civil War of <hi>Caeſar</hi> happened when he was about 60 years old. He uſed that Vacancy that belonged to his Age, neither did he ſtir any way out of the City. All thoſe things that were needful for ſuch of his Friends as went to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he ſupplied out of his own Eſtate. Neither did he offend his Friend <hi>Pompey;</hi> for he would receive of him no eminent bounty, as others, who by his means obtained honours or wealth, part of whom, even againſt their wills, followed him to the Field, and part ſtaid at home, not without his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93854:13"/>
great offence. But the ſitting ſtill of <hi>Atticus</hi> was ſo acceptable to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that when he returning Victor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Money from private perſons by his Letters, he was not only not troubleſome to <hi>Atticus,</hi> but delivered up the Son of his Siſter and <hi>Q. Cicero,</hi> taken in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp. Thus by keeping the old courſe of his Life, he eſcaped new dangers. After this, it followed, <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ſlain, when the Commonwealth ſeemed to be wholly in the power of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> and their party, and the whole City ſeemed to ſtand at gaze what <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> would do, He ſo dealt with <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> that that young man uſed no Equal more familiarly than he did this aged <hi>Atticus;</hi> and had him not only the Governor of his Council, but alſo the Companion of his Table. It was contrived by ſome, that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Treaſury ſhould be raiſed for the Murderers of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. They thought this might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be effected, if the chief of that Order did contribute Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93854:14"/>
Therefore <hi>Atticus</hi> was called by <hi>C. Falvius,</hi> a familiar Friend of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that he ſhould be the chief of that Undertaking: But he who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed good Offices to be done to his Friends without Faction, and always kept himſelf from ſuch kind of Councils, anſwered, That if <hi>Brutus</hi> would uſe any of his Riches, he might uſe what they were able to bear. But that he would neither ſpeak nor meet with any perſon about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that Ball of Contention by this one man's diſcretion was broken. Not long after, <hi>Anthony</hi> began to be uppermoſt, ſo that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> (the Affairs of thoſe Provinces (which by way of diſſimulation were aſſigned to them by the Conſuls) being deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) were baniſhed. <hi>Atticus,</hi> who would not give money with others, to that Party when it flouriſhed, ſent to <hi>Brutus,</hi> being now an Abject, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Italy,</hi> L L S <hi>Centum,</hi> or 3000 Crowns, and gave order, being abſent, that 300 <hi>Saſtertia</hi> more ſhould be delivered to him in <hi>Epirus:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93854:14"/>
did he, upon his Change, the more ſlatter <hi>Anthony,</hi> or leave the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed. After this followed the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel at <hi>Mucinia,</hi> wherein, if I ſhould only call him prudent, I ſhould ſay leſs than I ought; when rather he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, if a perpetual natural goodneſs, which is neither ſhaken nor diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Caſualties, is to be called Divineneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> being a declared enemy, went out of <hi>Italy,</hi> having no hope of reſtitution; not only his Enemies, who were then powerful and many, but even his very Friends gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to his Adverſaries, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped they ſhould obtain ſome benefit by hurting of him, perſecuting thoſe of his Family, deſired to plunder his wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> of all her goods, and went about to deſtroy his Children, <hi>Atticus</hi> uſing a moſt intimate familiarity with <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and being moſt friendly to <hi>Brutus,</hi> did not only not allow them to injure <hi>Antony;</hi> but on the contrary, as much as he could, hid thoſe of his Family flying out of the City, and helped
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93854:15"/>
them with the things they wanted: And to <hi>P. Volummius,</hi> ſuch things, that more could not have been from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whereas <hi>Fulvia</hi> was invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Suits, and vexed with great terrors, he performed his Office of kindneſs toward her with ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that ſhe gave no pledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Atticus:</hi> He was the Surety for all things. And further, whereas in her proſperous Fortune ſhe had bought a Farm to be paid at a day; and after this calamity, could not take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay, he interpoſed himſelf, and ſent her Money without Uſury and without Security; eſteeming it the greateſt gain to be known to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and grateful; and to make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that he was uſed to be a friend to men, and not to Fortune, which things while he did, no man could well think he did it to ſerve the time: For no man thought that <hi>Antony</hi> could ever return again. Nevertheleſs he was reproved by ſome great men, that he ſeemed too little to hate evil Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: But he being conſtant to his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93854:15"/>
own judgment, reſpected rather what was fit for him to do, than what others were ready to commend. The wheel of Fortune is ſuddenly turned. As <hi>Antony</hi> returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> every man thought <hi>Atticus</hi> was in great danger, by reaſon of his intimate familiarity with <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Brutus: Atticus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the coming in of the Emperor, withdrew from the City, fearing Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and hid himſelf with <hi>P. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lummius,</hi> to whom, as we have a little before ſhewn, he gave his aſſiſtance (ſo great was the variety of Fortune in thoſe times, that ſometimes theſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe were in the greateſt power or danger) and he had with him <hi>Q. Gellius Canius</hi> his Equal, and very like him. And this is another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the goodneſs of <hi>Atticus,</hi> that he lived ſo entirely with him whom he knew his Playfellow from a Boy, that their friendſhip increaſed even to their utmoſt old Age: But <hi>Antony,</hi> though he was carried with ſo great hatred againſt <hi>Cicero,</hi> that he was not only an enemy to him, but alſo to all his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93854:16"/>
Friends, and would baniſh them all; yet many reminding him, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the good offices of <hi>Atticus:</hi> and when one had enquired where he was, he wrote to him with his own hand, that he ſhould not fear; and that he ſhould preſently come to him; that he had exempted him and <hi>Gellius Canius</hi> from the number of the baniſhed: And leſt he ſhould fall into any danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was night, he ſent him a Guard.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Atticus</hi> in his greateſt fear, was a ſafeguard not only to himſelf, but alſo to him whom he held moſt dear: For he ſought not only for his own ſafety, but joyntly for others; that it might appear, that he would, no Fortune of his ſhould be disjoynted from his Friend: Therefore if a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot deſerves great praiſe, that ſaves his Ship from the Storm and Rockie Sea, why ſhould not his ſingular prudence be valued, which out of ſo many and ſo great Civil Storms came to ſafety? And to diſcharge himſelf from theſe evils, he did nothing elſe than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93854:16"/>
an aſſiſtance to the moſt in what he could. When the common people by the rewards of the Conqueror, redeemed ſome of thoſe that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, none of the Baniſhed came into <hi>Epirus,</hi> to whom any thing was wanting; and all that came thither, had liberty of remaining there. But alſo after the Battel at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and the death of <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus:</hi> He purpoſed to protect <hi>L. Julius Merilla</hi> the Pretor, and his Son <hi>Aulus Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus,</hi> and the reſt that were ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the like Fortune, and took order that to them all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould be privately conveyed from <hi>Epirus</hi> to <hi>Samothracia.</hi> It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to reckon up all things he did, and note ſuch as are neceſſary to be remembred. This one thing we would to be underſtood, that his Liberality was neither temporary nor crafty: That may be iudged by the things and times themſelves, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended not himſelf to thoſe that were proſperous, but always helped thoſe that were in diſtreſs. Who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93854:17"/>
therefore reſpected <hi>Servilia</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Brutus</hi> no leſs after his death, than while he flouriſhed: Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging his Liberality, he maintained no enmity, becauſe he neither injur'd any, neither if he received any injury, had he rather revenge than forget it. With a never dying Memory he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Benefits received; but thoſe which he did, he only remembred ſo long as he continued grateful that had received them. He did therefore ſo, that it ſeems truly ſaid, Every man's Manners faſhion to every man his own Fortune: And yet he firſt faſhioned himſelf before his Fortune, who took care that in nothing he might be juſtly puniſhed. By theſe things he brought to paſs that <hi>M. Vip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanius Agrippa</hi> (one joyned to young <hi>Caeſar</hi> in intimate familiarity) who by reaſon of his own Favour, and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s Authority, had a power upon perſons of every condition, did chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire the affinity of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and ſued to have the Noble Daughter of this <hi>Roman</hi> Knight in Marriage, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93854:17"/>
the maker of this Match was <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> the <hi>Triumvir</hi> of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; by whoſe Favour, when he might have increaſed his Poſſeſſions, he was ſo far from the deſire of Money, that he uſed it in no other thing than in deprecating either the dangers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of his Friends: Which was eminent even under the very Proſcription it ſelf. For whereas the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> according to the cuſtom whereby things were then managed, ſold the Goods of <hi>L. Sanfeus, a Roman</hi> Knight, his Equal, who lived many years at <hi>Athens,</hi> being thereunto led by the deſire of Philoſophy, and had fair poſſeſſions in <hi>Italy.</hi> By the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Induſtry of <hi>Atticus,</hi> it was brought to paſs, that by the ſame Meſſenger, <hi>Sanfeus</hi> was informed that he had loſt his Patrimony, and re-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it again. The ſame <hi>Atticus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Julius Claudius,</hi> the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Poet of this Age, next after the Death of <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Catullus,</hi> and a very good man, well inſtructed in the beſt Arts; who after the Proſcription
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93854:18"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, was for his large poſſeſſions in <hi>Africa,</hi> brought into the Liſt of the baniſhed in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by <hi>P. Volumnius</hi> General of the Workmen of <hi>Antony;</hi> which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it is difficult to judge whether it was more painful or glorious for him to effect, becauſe it was known that <hi>Atticus</hi> had a care for his Friends in their dangers, whether abſent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>And this man <hi>Atticus</hi> was eſteemed no leſs a good Father of a Family, than a good Citizen; for whereas he was full of money, no man was leſs a Buyer, or leſs a Builder: And yet he dwelt very well, and enjoyed all things of the beſt: For he had a Houſe in the <hi>Quirinal</hi> Hill, left to him hereditarily by his Unkle, whoſe pleaſantneſs was not ſo much in the building, as in the Groves adjoyning. For his Houſe being an ancient built Houſe, had more of Decency, than of Coſt; wherein he changed nothing but what he was compelled to by its decay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93854:18"/>
He had a Family, that if we may judge by its profitableneſs, was the beſt; if by the form of it, not mean; for in it were moſt learned Youths: excellent Clerks, and many well read in Books; that there was ſcarce a Foot-boy, but could well do any of theſe buſineſſes; in like manner other Artificers requiſite for houſhold Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſingular good: And yet he had none of theſe, but ſuch as were born and taught in his Houſe; which is a ſign not only of Continence, but of Diligence. For not intemperately to deſire that which thou feeſt deſired of many, ought to be eſteemed the ſign of a continent perſon: And to procure rather by diligence than pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, of no ſmall Induſtry. He was neat, not ſtately; handſom, not ſumptuous; he affected with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a cleanlineſs without ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: His Houſhold-ſtuff moderate, not much; ſo that in it neither Extream appeared: Neither ſhall I paſs by this, although I gueſs it may ſeem light to ſome: Whereas he was a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93854:19"/>
chief <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, and did very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally invite men of all Ranks to his Houſe, yet we know that he ſpent not monthly more than 3000 <hi>Aerii;</hi> (about 10 l. ſterling:) and this we ſpeak not by hear-ſay, but of our own knowledge; for by reaſon of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him, we were often preſent at his domeſtick Affairs. No man in his Feaſts heard any other <hi>Acroama</hi> than a Philoſophical Lecture, which we eſteemed moſt pleaſant; neither did he ever ſup without ſome philoſophical Lecture, that his gueſts might be delighted as well in their minds, as in their appetites; for he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe whoſe manners agreed with his. When ſo great an acceſſion of Money happened to him, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nothing in his daily deportment, nothing in the cuſtom of his Life: And he uſed ſo great moderation, that neither under the 200000 Seſterces (or 6000 Crowns) he had from his Father, he carried himſelf leſs ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, nor under the 100000 Seſterces, or 30000 Crowns (which he had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93854:19"/>
from his Unkle) he lived with greater affluence than he before had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But under both Fortunes he uſed the like port. He had no Gardens, no Country-Houſe, or ſumptuous mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine dwelling. Nor in <hi>Italy</hi> had he more than his Countrey Farm of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deali</hi> and <hi>Munantum.</hi> All his Rents were in what he had at <hi>Epirus,</hi> and City poſſeſſions, whereby it may be known, that he was fully accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meaſure out the employment of his Money, not by vaſt expence, but by Reaſon. He neither would ſpeak, nor could ſuffer a Lie: Therefore his Mirth was not without ſeverity, nor his Gravity without affability; ſo that it was hard to underſtand whether his Friends more reverenced than loved him. When any thing was deſired of him, he promiſed always with religious obſervance; becauſe he judged it the part of a light, not of a liberal man, to promiſe what he could not perform. His care was ſo great in endeavouring the fulfilling of what he once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for any other, that he ſeemed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93854:20"/>
herein not ſo much to do anothers bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, as his own: He never was weary of any buſineſs he undertook; for he eſteemed his own credit to be concerned in it, than which, nothing was dearer unto him: Whence it came to paſs that he performed all the buſineſſes of <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>Q. Cicero, Cato, Hortenſius, Aulus, Torquatus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Roman</hi> Knights beſides.</p>
               <p>Whereby it may be well judged that he avoided the procuration of the Commonwealth, not for ſloth, but in judgment. I can give no greater te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his humanity, than that being a young man, he was moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to <hi>Sylla,</hi> an old man; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old man, moſt delightful to <hi>Brutus,</hi> a young man: But with his Equals, <hi>Q. Hortenſius</hi> and <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> he ſo lived, that it is hard to judge for what Age he was fitteſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Cicero</hi> ſo greatly loved him, that his Brother <hi>Quintius</hi> was not more dear or familiar to him: And this was an evidence hereof, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Books that are now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93854:20"/>
in which he makes mention of him, there are ſixteen Volumes of Epiſtles ſent to <hi>Atticus,</hi> from the firſt Conſulate of <hi>Cicero,</hi> to the laſt end of his life; which whoſoever reads, will not much want a continued Hiſtory of thoſe times: For all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſigns of the great men, the faults of the Commanders, the changes of the Commonwealth, are ſo fully written, that all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thoſe Writings; and it may be eaſily collected that Prudence is in a manner Divination: For <hi>Cicero</hi> did not only foretel thoſe things that afterwards fell out in his life-time; but alſo he preſaged, as a Prophet, thoſe things that now come to paſs. And what ſhould I relate more tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Piety of <hi>Atticus,</hi> when as I my ſelf heard him truly glorying at the Funeral of his Mother, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 90 years old, he buried when he was 67 years old, that he never was reconciled to his Mother, nor ever was at difference with his Siſter, who was near his own Age; which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93854:21"/>
was a ſign that either there was never any controverſie between them, or that he was of that indulgence to his Relations, that he held it a crime to be angry with thoſe whom he ought to love. Neither did he this only by nature, although all of us ought to obey it; but alſo by his Learning: For he ſo well underſtood the precepts of the chief Philoſophers, that he uſed them for the ordering his life, and not for oſtentation. He was a ſtrict imitator of the cuſtoms of the Ancients, and a lover of Antiquity, which he ſo diligently knew, that he declared it in that Volume where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he adorned the <hi>Roman</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: For there was no Law, no Peace, no War, no notable thing of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is not ſet down in its order of time in that Volume. And (which is a thing of great difficulty) he ſo unſolded the Original of Families, that we may thereby know the pedigrees of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men: He did this alſo ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other Books, ſo that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93854:21"/>
of <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> he deduced in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nian</hi> Family from its root down to this Age; ſetting down who, and of whom every one aroſe, what honours they received, and in what time. In like manner, he did at the requeſt of <hi>Marcellus Claudius,</hi> touching the Family of the <hi>Marcelli:</hi> And at the requeſt of <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> and <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Maximus,</hi> touching the Families of the <hi>Cornelii</hi> and <hi>Fabii,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Emilii:</hi> Than which Books, nothing can be more pleaſant to them that have the deſire of the knowledge of eminent men. Alſo I believe he had skill in Poetry, leſt he ſhould be wanting in the ſweetneſs thereof: For he declared in Verſe what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons exceeded others of the <hi>Roman</hi> people in honour and amplitude of great Exploits; ſo that under the Statues of every perſon he wrote in no more than four or five verſes their Exploits and Magiſtracies (which is ſcarce to be believed) that ſo great things ſhould be ſo briefly declared. There was alſo another Book of his in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93854:22"/>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> of the Conſulate of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto theſe things were publiſhed by us, <hi>Atticus</hi> living. Now becauſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was pleaſed that we ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him, we will proſecute the reſt; and as much as we may, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Readers by examples of things, as we have above declared, that every mans manners procure to him his Fortune; for he being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Equeſtrial Order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was born, arrived to the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Julius,</hi> the Emperors Son, whoſe acquaintance he formerly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no other thing than the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of his Life; whereby he won to himſelf other Princes of an equal Dignity and lower Fortune: For ſo great a proſperity followed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that Fortune denied him nothing which ſhe had before given or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon any, whereunto any Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> could poſſibly attain. Now there was born to <hi>Atticus,</hi> a Neece of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to whom he had married his Virgin-Daughter: her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce a year old: <hi>Caeſar</hi> eſpouſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93854:22"/>
too <hi>Tiberius Claudius Nero</hi> his Son in-Law, born of <hi>Druſilla;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction confirmed their friendſhip, and rendred their familiar intercourſe the more frequent; although before theſe Eſpouſals, not only when he was abſent from the City, he never ſent Letters to any of his Relations; but he ſent <hi>Atticus</hi> word what he did, and principally what he read, and in what places, and how long he was to ſtay; but alſo when he was in the City, and by reaſon of his infinite buſineſs, enjoyed <hi>Atticus</hi> oftentimes leſs than he deſired; yet no day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſſed, wherein he did not write to him, wherein he did not enquire of him ſomewhat touching Antiquity; ſometimes he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him ſome Poetical Queſtion, ſometimes merrily jeſting, he drew out from him Letters of length: Whereby it came to paſs, that the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> built in the Capitol by <hi>Romulus,</hi> by length of time and neglect, becoming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, was fallen down, that by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93854:23"/>
the perſwaſion of <hi>Atticus, Caeſar</hi> took order for rebuilding it: Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, was he leſs complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letters foom <hi>Anthony,</hi> inſomuch that while he was in exile, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Atticus</hi> what was done in the Land of his Exile, what he did, and what he cared for: What a kind of matter this was, he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily eſteem that can judge of how great wiſdom it was to retain the uſe and good will of them between whom there was not only a mutual emulation of matters of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but between whom ſo great detraction of either from other, did intervene, as was neceſſarily to be between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> while each deſired to be the Prince, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the whole world. In this manner when he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated 77 years of his life, and to the extremity of his old Age had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed no leſs in Dignity than in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Fortune (for he gain'd great poſſeſſions, by no other means than his goodneſs; and had enjoyed ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93854:23"/>
great a proſperity of health, that for thirty years he wanted no Phyſick) he got a Diſeaſe, which himſelf and his Phyſicians at firſt deſpiſed; for at firſt they thought it a <hi>Teneſinus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſpeedy and eaſie Medicines were propounded.</p>
               <p>Under this Diſeaſe he continued three Months without any pain, but what he received from the endeavour of his Cure. Suddenly ſo great a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Diſeaſe broke in upon one of his Inteſtines, that at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end a putrid <hi>Fiſtula</hi> broke out through his Loyns. And before this happened, after that he felt his pains daily to encreaſe, and that a Fever came upon him, he commanded his Son-in-Law <hi>Agrippa</hi> to be ſent for to him, and with him <hi>P. Cornelius Balbus,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Peduceus.</hi> As ſoon as he ſaw they were come, leaning upon his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, he ſaid, There is no need for me in many words to declare how great care and diligence I have uſed in the preſervation of my health, ſince I have you the witneſſes of it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93854:24"/>
I hope I have ſatisfied you that I have omitted nothing which might belong to my recovery; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, that I ſhould now adviſe my ſelf: I would not have you ignorant of this thing; for I am purpoſed to ceaſe to nouriſh any diſeaſe: For theſe many dayes whatſoever meat I have taken, I have thereby ſo leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened out my life, that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my pains without any hope of health: Therefore firſt I deſire of you, that you do approve of my purpoſe; and next, that you do not vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſwade me. This Speech being uttered with ſo great ſetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech and countenance, that he ſeemed not to depart from life, but out of one houſe into another: But when <hi>Agrippa</hi> weeping and Kiſſing him, did pray and beſeech him that he would not haſten that to himſelf, which Nature would compel; and becauſe he might then live ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer, that he ſhould reſerve himſelf as long as he might to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Friends, he ſtopt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93854:24"/>
by a ſilent obſtinacy: So when he had forborn Meat two dayes, his Fever ſuddenly left him; and his Diſeaſe ſeemed more eaſie, yet he continued his purpoſe. In the fifth day therefore after he had taken this reſolution, <hi>prid. Calend. April is, C. Domitius</hi> and <hi>C. Soſius</hi> being Conſuls, he died. He was raiſed up in his Bed, as he commanded, without any Funeral Pomp; all good men, and a great Concourſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People accompanying him: He was buried near the <hi>Via Appia</hi> at the fifth Stone from the City in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of <hi>Q.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Such was the Life and Death of this worthy <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> deſcribed by one that was Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93854:25"/>
with him, and well acquainted with him, namely, <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> who, as himſelf witneſſeth, wrote this Hiſtory about the beginning of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that every circumſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deſerves a diſtinct obſervation.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall proceed to do theſe thing: Firſt to give a <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Account</hi> of the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and of thoſe great occurrences that hapned in the <hi>Roman</hi> State within the compaſs of his Life. Secondly, To give ſome account of the reaſon of thoſe great motions that hapned in this period in the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, To make ſome Obſervations touching the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and wiſe Methods that <hi>Atticus</hi> uſed to preſerve himſelf and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate without loſs or diſhonour among all theſe great motions, revolutions and dangers that hapned in the State of <hi>Rome</hi> by theſe Civil Diſſentions.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, I ſhall give a ſhort <hi>Chronological Account</hi> of the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and thoſe great Diſturbances and Civil Wars that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93854:25"/>
hapned in <hi>Rome</hi> during the time of his Life, that ſo it may appear what they were when they happened, and the various ſucceſſes they had, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at once it may appear what difficulties and ſtorms hapned in his time, and how they were by this mans prudence weathered in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral periods of his Life. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall be but brief, and mention only thoſe of great moment, and ſuch wherein this mans concernment prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally lay; omitting many, which though had they been ſingle, might have been worth the remembring; yet they were but branches of theſe greater commotions, and ſprang from them, and were but ſmall in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall I be over curious in this Accompt, but only mention them ſo far as they conduce to my purpoſe. He that liſts to take a full view of all the Hiſtory, may find at large in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Florus, Paterculus, Dion. Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Plutarchus</hi> in the Lives of <hi>Maritis, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Sertorius, Pompey, Caeſar, Anthony,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93854:26"/>
and <hi>Octoevius,</hi> afterwards' <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall diſpoſe of the Times in their order, according as they fall in the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, becauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among Chronologers touching the Computations of the years of the world, of the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the <hi>Olympiades</hi> into which theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences might be otherwiſe aptly enough diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>POMPONIUS ATTICUS</hi> died in the 77<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Age, <hi>C. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> and <hi>C. Soſius</hi> being Conſuls, as <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> tells us, which was in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the next year before the <hi>Pugna Actiaca</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> and 2 years before the taking of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was the fatal and funeral deletion of <hi>Antony.</hi> The death therefore of <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> was in or very near the 4683 year of the <hi>Julian</hi> period, and by this means we come to find out the ſeveral periods of his Birth, and other the occurrences that hapned to him and the State of <hi>Rome</hi> within the time of his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93854:26"/>
If therefore we ſubduct the years of <hi>Atticus</hi> his Age, namely, 77 years, current out of 4683 years, it gives us the time of his Birth, <hi>viz.</hi> about the year 4606 of the <hi>Julian</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, in or near the Conſulate of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius Galba</hi> and <hi>Marcus Scaurus.</hi>

               <p>But the Army being conſtant to <hi>Sylla,</hi> would not ſubmit to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Marius.</hi> Whereupon, <hi>Marius</hi> put divers of the Friends of <hi>Sylla</hi> to death, and made a great alteration in the State of <hi>Rome.</hi>

that might probably and reaſonably ſucceed his Unkle in all his Greatneſs, eſpecially being declared his adopted Heir.</p>

               <p>The War againſt <hi>Anthony</hi> ſucceeded well, and the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> party and Senate having now obtained their ends in the honour they did to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> namely, the dividing him from <hi>Anthony,</hi> and thereby ſtrengthening themſelves, and weakning their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, in the ſame year began to give evidence of their publick neglect of <hi>Octavius:</hi> And having now ſerved their own turns by him againſt <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> declared their publick diſlike and jealouſie of <hi>Octavius, Caſſius, Brutus,</hi> and the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> party were the great Favorites of the Senate.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year <hi>Lepidus</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to <hi>Octavius,</hi> having received <hi>Anthony,</hi> a declared enemy, was alſo by

the Senate declared an Enemy to the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that now <hi>Octavius,</hi> though not a declared Enemy, yet began to be either ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or neglected; and <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> declared enemies.</p>
               <p>This was that time mentioned in the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> wherein the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Anthony</hi> was eſteemed deſperate, and he invaded by his Friends as well as his Enemies; when yet <hi>Atticus</hi> ſtood by his Relations, and protected them againſt injuries.</p>
               <p>The Caſe thus ſtanding with theſe three great men, <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> ſolicited <hi>Octavius</hi> to fall in with them, otherwiſe he might look for the ſame ill ſucceſs from the Senate that they had themſelves found; and that as now he began to be neglected, ſo in a ſhort time he would be oppreſſed by the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> party.

among themſelves, as they thought good.</p>
               <p>This being thus agreed between them, before the ſame was known to the Senate, <hi>Octavius</hi> being willing to have a fair occaſion to break with the Senate, demanded a kindneſs, which he was ſure they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, namely, the Conſulate; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was rejected, and ſo had a fair occaſion to fall off from them, who formerly and now had ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and affronted him.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, <hi>Octavius, Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> joyned their Forces, declared their purpoſe to reform the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth under the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of them three, and march with their full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>Rome;</hi> which they enter and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and in purſuance of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer counſel and purpoſe, diſpoſe of Provinces, create Conſuls, ſome of thoſe that oppoſed them, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, others they killed; amongſt whom, was <hi>Marens Tullius Cicero,</hi> the great Friend of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and the bitter Enemy of <hi>Anthony.</hi>

               <p>It is truly noted by the <hi>Florentine</hi> Polititian, that the <hi>Romans</hi> when Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors over their neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, never uſed mediocrity or a mean towards thoſe they conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but either uſed ſo great benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or favour towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, that they thereby obliged them from a future revolt; or elſe dealt ſo ſeverely with them, that they utterly diſabled them from it.

               <argument>
                  <p>Touching Factions in general, and the reaſons of theſe great Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and why they happened more at this time than for many hundreds of years before.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Roman</hi> State in its firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſeemed to be principally Monarchical, yet ended with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, conſiſting at firſt of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and afterwards of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93854:38"/>
perſons, called <hi>Patres</hi> or <hi>Patricii:</hi> After the expulſion of their Kings, they fell in to a Commonwealth; conſiſting of their Senate, and two Conſuls yearly elected, who had a power in ſome things Regal. Afterwards, there growing Conteſts between the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and <hi>Patricii</hi> of the one part, and the reſt of the People of the other part, the conſtitution of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth was much altered by the admiſſion of a popular power of the Tribunes elected by the people; ſo that now their Commonwealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be mixed, partly of an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> reſiding in the Senate; and ſome what analogical to a qualified and elective Monarchy, reſiding in the Conſuls; and ſome what of a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> reſiding in the <hi>Tribunitia pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas,</hi> in the Tribunes elective by the people.</p>
               <p>Thus this mixed Republick grew great and powerful, and continued many years in great ſtrength and peace, only ſometimes there aroſe jars and conteſts between the power
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93854:38"/>
of the Senate and People, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſeldom broke out into wars, but ſometimes by the prudent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſome wiſe Senators, in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among the people; ſometimes by ſeaſonable conceſſions from the Senate to them; ſometimes by the occurrence of ſome foreign war, theſe differences were often allay'd or diverted without any great detriment to the Publick.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Marius</hi> being a rough, fierce and bold perſon, a man of Wit and Courage, a good Souldier, ſucceſsful, ambitious, and that could not endure any Opponent or Rival, began that Fire in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſcarce ever left burning, till the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was at laſt neceſſarily reſolved into the Monarchy of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And all thoſe Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Wars, all thoſe Rapines and Violences, thoſe Murders and Baniſhments, that in the ſpace of about fifty years after the ſixth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate of <hi>Marius,</hi> filled the City and Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> were the ſucceſs of that Faction that he began, and of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93854:39"/>
that Breach that he firſt made in the Texture and Contiguation of that goodly ſtructure of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Praeludia</hi> to the Monarchy of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as the only Cure thereof.</p>
               <p>Now in as much as the frame of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth conſiſted of the Conſuls, the Senate, and the Tribunes, and had ſo ſtood for many years; and though in all that time, there had been men of Spirit, and ambitious enough to trouble a State, and there wanted not frequent brawls between the Nobility and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all this time, which might have as well given opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to troubleſome Spirits, and to have given fire to the Ambition and Diſcontents of perſons, and thereby have raiſed Civil Wars, and put the State of <hi>Rome</hi> into blood, It will be ſeaſonable for us to enquire what the reaſon might be why that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was no ſooner engaged in Civil Wars; or if at any time, ſome ſuch thing happened (as ſome ſuch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93854:39"/>
there ſometimes were, though not ſo great or dangerous) they were ſoon extinguiſhed, and things quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a peaceable ſtate; and yet in the time of <hi>Marius</hi> ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War begun as never left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> till it had in a great meaſure changed its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And how it came to paſs that the Factions in <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo deeply radicated that the Commonwealth could not be cured of it, till it grew into an Empire, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I come to the diſcuſſion of that enquiry, it will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the application of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in this Diſcourſe, to premiſe ſomething touching Factions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; what they are, and what are ſo truly denominated.</p>
               <p>And I muſt premiſe, that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of Kingdoms, States or Commonwealths are of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious frames and conſtitutions; and thoſe things may be lawful accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtitution of one State,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93854:40"/>
which are neither lawful or tolerable according to the conſtitution of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State.</p>
               <p>And therefore what I am about to ſay concerning Factions in a State, muſt be underſtood with relation to that or the like State or Government whereof I write, <hi>viz.</hi> the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it ſtood in thoſe times when theſe troubles broke out: And this I mention to prevent miſapplication and miſs-interpretation of what I am wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>By a Faction in a Commonwealth, I do not mean that Government, which is by Law or cuſtom ſetled; and therefore where the ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Monarchical, I do not take the adhering to the King, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or where the Government is Ariſtocratical, or by a Senate, as it was ſometimes in <hi>Rome,</hi> or mixt, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ariſtocratical, and partly popular, as it was after the ſetling of the <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitia Poteſtas;</hi> that eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the adherence to it, was no Faction; but it is ſo far from it, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93854:40"/>
the adherence to the Government le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally eſtabliſhed, whether it be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, Ariſtocratical, Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or mixed, is the duty of every good Subject and Citizen.</p>
               <p>But that which I call a Faction in a State, is one of theſe enſuing kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a party of men ſhall conſpire and unite themſelves againſt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government, to ſubvert or alter it; and this is the greateſt Faction, <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leſae Majeſtatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When a party of men ſhall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and confederate themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to gain either ſomething to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to others, by force or fraud, againſt the will and conſent of that Power that by Laws is intruſted with the conceſſion or denial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When any perſon entruſted by the Sovereign power, with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power or Authority, ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by force or fraud to extend that power wherewith he is entruſted, beyond the bounds of it: as if in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93854:41"/>
State of <hi>Rome</hi> the Tribunes ſhould by ſtirring up the People, or by force or ſecret confederacy, encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power of the Senate or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, or <hi>è converſo:</hi> For though by the conſtitution of the Government, they were inveſted with a juſt and real power, yet when by violence or fraud they accroach a larger power, this acoroachment is an act done by them as private perſons, and without the bounds and limits of their Authority, and therefore in ſuch an Enterprize, they are no more excuſed from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by their Authority that they had, than if they were without any ſuch Authority; becauſe they herein act beyond the bounds, and without the warrant of that Authority, and conſequently as private perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When two or more great and ominent perſons or parties, and it may be of a conſiderable intereſt in a State or Government, engage one againſt another, at firſt, it may be, privately, and as opportunity grows, it may be, more openly and viſibly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93854:41"/>
croſſing each other, accuſing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly each other; each party ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to be of their party: At length uſing diſcriminations of deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or habits or ſigns; and poſſibly in a little time, publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and rencounters: And at laſt, it may be, open hoſtility; and all this while, the true real Governors of that State, whether Monarch or Senate, ſit ſtill and look on it, may be, out of fear of being oppreſſed by the power of both or either party; it may be out of reſpect to ſome of the heads of either party, it may be out of policy, to ſuffer either party to worry and weaken, and ruine one another; hoping thereby to preſerve the Government; or it may be, one of a weak and ſame, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opinion, contenting themſelves with the name or external face, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and enſigns of Government, and the profeſſed reſpects of either party; but not daring to interpoſe any acts of real authority, to ſuppreſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy thoſe growing miſchiefs; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93854:42"/>
they ſhould not be able to carry it through in reſpect of the potency of parties: and ſo the true Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors ſtand by, and look on, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with the complements and profeſſion of ſubjection by both parties; till at laſt one party getting the better of the other, layes by the diſguiſe of pretended Subjection, and gives the Law to his lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and makes them do what he pleaſes, or ſuffer what it inflicts. And this commonly is the miſchief that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a Government that out of any the beforementioned reſpects, ſuffer Factions to grow ſo great, that at laſt they become Maſterleſs, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conjunction of both parties, or prevalence of one, give the Law to their lawful Governors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When ſome particular perſons that are or are not in any authority in a State or Commonwealth, deſign ſome matter either for themſelves, or againſt any other; and to effect that deſign, do by ſecret means or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or fraud, or otherwiſe, draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93854:42"/>
the power of that State wherein they live, to be their Engines and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments under the countenance and ſignature of their authority, to effect their Deſign.</p>
               <p>For though the authority of the State is engaged therein, yet that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained by the force, fraud or other Engine, and to ſerve the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt or end of a party, and not acting according to the true and native freedom and integrity of their Inſtitution, excuſeth not this from being really a Faction, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it be ſpeciouſly guilded over with the countenance of publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: For inſtance; Suppoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> two great leading men in <hi>Rome,</hi> had a jealouſie and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity one againſt the other, and <hi>Marius</hi> deſires that <hi>Sylla</hi> be deprived of the Province allotted to him, and that it be conferred on him: On the other ſide, perchance <hi>Sylla</hi> hath the like deſign againſt <hi>Marius; Marius</hi> ſolicits by Bribes or Menaces as many of the Senate as he can prevail with, to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93854:43"/>
take his part, and <hi>Sylla</hi> doth the like for his part: The Senate is near divided: <hi>Sylla</hi> procures ſome of the Senators of <hi>Marius</hi>'s part, to be ſent away about ſome other employments, and thereby <hi>Marius</hi> is over-voted, and deprived of his Province; then <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> makes in with the Tribunes, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licits the people to be of his party, and a tumult is thereby raiſed in the behalf of <hi>Marius,</hi> and thereby, and by thoſe Friends of <hi>Marius</hi> that are of the Senate, the former Decree is repealed, and then <hi>Marius</hi> is reſtored to his own Province, and alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Province.</p>
               <p>The next day, <hi>Sylla,</hi> who is potent in the Army, complains of the wrong done him, and engageth the Army for him; whereby again both Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes and Senate are over-powered; and the Senators of <hi>Marius</hi>'s part, withdraw themſelves for fear of the Army, and now <hi>Sylla</hi> carries it both with the Tribunes and Senate, and re-obtains his own and <hi>Marius</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and perchance <hi>Marius</hi> ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93854:43"/>
exile, though here be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Governors in theſe viciſſitudes,</p>
               <p>Yet theſe are nevertheleſs but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions. And this was moſt commonly the Diſcipline of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Factions of <hi>Rome;</hi> or if they that could get to have more intereſt or power with the people, or with the Army, or could make the more bold and daring part of the Senate, though leſs in number, to over-rule the greater part, or if they were exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively loved, or exceſſively feared, or were ſubtle and crafty, to fit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the People or the Senate to their Deſigns, theſe were ſure to have a countenance of Authority quickly for what they did; ſo that in the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of Factions, and of their prevalence, they never wanted a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natuſconſultum,</hi> or a <hi>Plebiſcitum</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what ſoever they did. And in the mean time, the favourers of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party, for fear, or by-ends, withdrawing themſelves from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Aſſemblies; and then the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93854:44"/>
others did what they pleaſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their own Party. And when it came to the turn of the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be uppermoſt, the ſame method was commonly held; the friends of the depreſſed with drawing themſelves, or ſitting ſilent, or changing their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, and then all went ſmoothly the other way: Whereby it came to paſs, that as <hi>Sylla</hi> at his return, wanted not the Decree of the Senate to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all his Murders and Proſcriptions; ſo <hi>Marius</hi> at his return, wanted not the like for his Murders and Proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the party of <hi>Sylla;</hi> and the ſame viciſſitudes obtained between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Brutus</hi> and <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Antonius</hi> and <hi>Octavius;</hi> and for the moſt part, the Factions of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof I have written, were of this latter kind, and managed under the ſhadow and umbrage of the Civil Authority, though in their original they aroſe from the pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, envy and emulations, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and deſigns, diſguſts and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of particular perſons, who could
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93854:44"/>
not brook any whom they ſuſpected might be Rivals of their Greatneſs, Honour or Power. And theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, bore down the Magiſtracy of <hi>Rome</hi> before them; and yet ſooner or later grounded all their exorbitances under the ſtamp, ſignature and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Authority of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Governors.</p>
               <p>Now though it may be true that theſe Decrees of the Authority eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, though by this means obtained, are binding, while they ſtand in force; yet the manner of obtaining ſuch Decrees by theſe and the like means, are unjuſt and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in true intrinſick juſtice, do not excuſe or juſtifie the obtainers thereof from oppreſſion and injuſtice, though they may poſſibly, for the time, be temporary projections of them, when they continue unrepeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or unavoided.</p>
               <p>Now a few words touching the ſecond, namely, the Reaſons why theſe Civil Wars broke out more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly and violently at this time than formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93854:45"/>
It is true, that the very Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Make of ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as <hi>Rome</hi> had, being partly Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, and partly Popular, and with ſome ſhadow of Monarchical Power in the Conſuls, renders ſuch a State very powerful in relation to foreign Undertakings and Wars; for foreign Engagements do concenter and unite a people, and the Fabrick of ſuch a State renders their power united againſt a foreign power, and conſequently more forcible, formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for the moſt part ſucceſsful; the weight of the whole Body moving together in ſuch foreign Enterprizes: But on the other ſide, theſe Forms of Governments have this Diſeaſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to them, that they are unquiet, and full of Factions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; eſpecially when they have no foreign diverſions.</p>
               <p>Great Bodies, they move ſlowly, yet move they muſt; and if the Mill have not Corn to grind, the upper and nether Milſtone will grind each other. If we ſhould ſuppoſe the ſupream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93854:45"/>
had been only Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, by a Senate, conſiſting of three hundred perſons, Reaſon and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews that Factions are apt to riſe even in ſuch a Council: Much more when the common people were ſharers alſo in the Government.</p>
               <p>For firſt, Commonly in ſuch great Aſſemblies, ſome particular perſons are the leading men, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intitled by their parts, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or intereſt, to govern the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and that raiſeth envy and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in others, who think they have as much reaſon to ſway in ſupream Councils as others; which preſently engageth that Council in parties and Factions.</p>
               <p>Again, 2. It is commonly ſeen in ſuch numerous Councils, where they are ſupream and abſolute, ſome there are that drive on their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, offices and advancement of their Families and Relations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others among them, have the ſame deſigns for themſelves, which muſt needs croſs and diſappoint one
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93854:46"/>
another, every one gathers and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth as many as they can, to carry on their own deſigns; which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engageth either the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or very conſiderable numbers thereof into Parties and Factions: Upon theſe, and many the like emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, where the ſupreme Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſts in many, it is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to avoid breaking themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parties or Factions; unleſs ſome one ſupream Governour be to check and controul, and diſperſe theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; or unleſs ſome foreign emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency happen, that may concenter them in a common union againſt a common Enemy: But beſides all this, the mixture of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors, conſiſting partly of the <hi>Patricii,</hi> Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates or Nobility, and partly of the People and their Tribunes, who were their Delegates, between which the Soveraign power was in many things diſtributed and divided, did ſtill admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion of conteſt and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and gave opportunity to buſie and unquiet and diſcontented ſpirits,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93854:46"/>
to intereſs themſelves with the Senate againſt the people; or <hi>è converſo:</hi> but eſpecially with the popular party, and by ſecret ſuggeſtions or inſinuations, or by open Declamations or Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to create diſturbances in the State; a co-ordinate power in ſeveral parties, Councils or Offices rarely reſting quiet till ſome one perſon or party hath gotten the maſtery of the reſt; as appears among many inſtances in that of the <hi>Roman Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Antonius</hi> and <hi>Lepidus;</hi> wherein, firſt <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and then <hi>Antonius</hi> were reduced into the ſingle power of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> together with the Empire: And beſides the Conſtitution of their Commonwealth, partly conſiſting in the authority of their Conſuls, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Senate, partly in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and their Tribunes, there was yet a fourth fountain of continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; namely, their ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: If any of the Conſuls, that were annually choſen, was of a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous or of ambitious nature, and it may be of too great a Spirit for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93854:47"/>
his Companion, or not willing to be diſpoſſeſſed of his power at his years end, and his preſent power in the Army, gave him opportunity to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ambition: If a man were of a great wit, intereſt and elocution, he had a great opportunity of leading the Senate, or the greater number of them, whither he pleaſed, unleſs he had ſome Antagoniſt of equal wit, intereſt and elocution, and then their colliſion begat emulation and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Factions. Again, a man that was bold and confident, and a great aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Liberty, that could make plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Invectives againſt the Senate or Nobility, and could cry up the intereſt of the people, that could find faults with the adminiſtrations of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or could ſet up ſome popular Law (as that of the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> which bred ſo many tumults in that State) ſuch a man had an admirable oportunity to work Tumults and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions among the people: Again, if a man that were an Officer in the Army (as the Conſuls, the <hi>Magiſtor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93854:47"/>
Equitum</hi> was) and were eſteemed a gallant man, a man of courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and conduct in the Army, a man ſucceſsful and fortunate, liberal, and of a good preſence and elocution, ſuch a man had a great power and influence over the Army, could lead them as he pleaſed, make what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, innovations he pleaſed by them in the Commonwealth; ſo that the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they could not live without a ſtanding Army, conſidering their Military condition, ſo they were in danger by them, if they had the leaſt intermiſſion from foreign Wars; that their Magiſtrates, Senate, People, Army, were as ſo many common places, and topiques, in or from which, men of unquiet, ambitious and turbulent ſpirits, had opportunities to create or nouriſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Parties, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily in time, either by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual colliſions, or the prevailing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of either, make great changes, or ſtrange Earthquakes and Concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the State.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93854:48"/>
Certainly the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate were a noble Council, without which <hi>Rome</hi> could never have riſen to that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; yet they being ſupreme and numerous, could never be long free from Factions: much leſs when the Tribunes of the people, and the great Officers of the Army had ſuch a ſhare in the Government.</p>
               <p>But theſe are but Generals; there ſeem certain ſpecial reaſons that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned theſe great and continuing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Civil Broyls in the State of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time; beſides that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral habitude and propenſity to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ariſing from the Frame and Conſtitution of their Governore, when they had no Foreign Enemies; which ſeem to be principally theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> about that time, and ſhortly after that under <hi>Sylla,</hi> after their Victory over the Confederates of <hi>Italy,</hi> had goten the Maſtery of all their neighbouring Nations, that they ſeemed to have little left for them to do in Military Engagements, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93854:48"/>
therefore being a buſie, active people, they were ſtill reſtleſs, and for want of enemies abroad, they were (by the reſtleſneſs of their active ſouls, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to Wars) carried on to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their fervour and fire one among another: And the wiſer part of the Council eaſily found that this would be the neceſſary conſequence of their peace with others; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had ſubdued all their near neighbours, and had little neceſſity of any foreign wars, yet they ſought occaſions for the diverſion of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet humour, by ſending abroad their Armies to remote countries, as <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in their unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry War againſt <hi>Mithridates;</hi> uſing that means to keep things quiet at home, by employing their fiery, active ſpirits in remote actions, dealing by their Armies, and military, ambitious men, as they ſay, Conjurers do with the Unquiet Spirits that they have raiſed, ſet them about ſome impoſſible or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult employment; as, filling a Sieve
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93854:49"/>
with water, or making a Rope of Sand, that they may not do miſchief. So the <hi>Roman</hi> Councils, to keep reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ambitious and troubleſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in motion and action, though they had many times little need or reaſon for it, rather ſought enemies at a diſtance, or made them ſuch, that they might divert by revulſion thoſe other inconveniences that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might find from them at home. But now when theſe great Broyls fell out, namely, after the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Confederacy of <hi>Marius,</hi> they had in effect, ſubdued all Opponents; and although <hi>Sylla</hi> was employed then in the War againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> yet he did but play with it, and protracted the War, which he at his pleaſure, could have ſooner concluded; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the peace he made with him at laſt. This ſeems therefore the firſt reaſon of the eruption of theſe inteſtine Wars at this time; becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> power had maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their neighbouring Nations, and reduced them into a perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93854:49"/>
or into ſuch a kind of aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with them, as ſtill left the <hi>Roman</hi> State the Supream over them. And theſe Wars they then had, were not ſuch as were neceſſary, nor near, but ſuch as were at a diſtance, and undertaken either politickly, for the end above declared, or at leaſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, and to augment their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, not out of any other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond cauſe or reaſon ſeems to be this; they at firſt gave too much head, and too much power to ambitious and intemperate ſpirits; which thereupon radicated a Faction, and habituated great ſpirits to the ſame. <hi>Marius</hi> was a high-ſpirited, and factious man, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth indulged him too much, and too often in great Commands and great Offices. He was ſix times cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Conſul, and once he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo; and by this means, he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed and habituated many of the Grandees of <hi>Rome</hi> to the knack, and practice and skill of managing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93854:50"/>
and when <hi>Sylla</hi> was ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he grew a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, truſted with great power, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes made Conſul, and at laſt Dictator; and under his Diſcipline, thoſe of his party got. the trick of managing a Faction, and taſted the ſweetneſs of power, and could never be perfectly weaned from it: the like might be inſtanced in <hi>Pompey, Caeſar, Antonius, Brutus, Octavius, &amp;c.</hi> For theſe men were lifted up ſo high by the great and over-long truſt, and power, and offices, and commands that were committed to them, that in a little time they grew too big for the Commonwealth; and although the Senate and People bore the name of a Commonwealth, yet in truth they were but Ciphers, and did no more than what theſe great men, while they were in power, and had the Army at their command, did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command, or direct, or permit. And theſe great Commanders and Officers, though they pretended an inferiority to the Commonwealth,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93854:50"/>
and that they were but their ſervants, yet in truth, thoſe were but Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for in their ſeveral viciſſitudes of power, they exerciſed as great and greater Monarchical, or rather Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical power than ever <hi>Octavius</hi> did after he was ſaluted by the name and ſtyle of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And by this means the generality of great Spirits in <hi>Rome,</hi> were taught to deſpiſe the former regular Conduct of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and aſpired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater matters, initiated and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves under Factions, learned the art and skill of them, deſigned to themſelves as much greatneſs as they had ſeen acquired by thoſe Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees to whom they had joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and were not patient of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer under the Commands of the Senate, but were filled with ſpirits, and habits and deſignes, not conſiſtent with a Commonwealth; and accordingly as opportunity hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, they broke out into new inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine commotions; whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcipline of the Commonwealth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93854:51"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> was not to make men too great, or if neceſſity exacted it of them, as when they created Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; in time of deſperate danger or neceſſity, they continued it not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the neceſſity laſted: By this means men were not very long in great power or offices, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were kept from growing too great.</p>
               <p>Factions growing by them, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their umbrage, had not time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ferment or take root, or grow ſtrong, but a ſubſtitution of new men in office and power, ſoon ſuppreſſed, or ſcattered, or ſtarved the budding Factions before they grew too maſterleſs. And men that were naturally high-ſpirited, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, or fond of power or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had thereby diſcouragement or interruption in their projects, and the generality tutored into obedience and quietneſs, having no examples of ſucceſsful Factions: And by this great moderation and reſtraint of too great or too long power in any, they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93854:51"/>
prevented that envy and animoſity, which is naturally apt to riſe againſt men in a Commonwealth, that are grown too great or too powerful: But on the contrary, the courſe that about <hi>Marius</hi>'s time was uſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> gave neceſſary occaſions of the growth and turbulency of Factions by theſe three neceſſary conſequents thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that was thus raiſed to too great and long a domination, was neceſſitated to maintain a Faction to ſupport and keep him in that ſtate of Grandeur to which he arrived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the accuſtomed Grandeur of any one perſon did as naturally raiſe envy in others againſt him, and conſequently the raiſing of Faction againſt him to ſuppreſs or reduce him to a lower condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſuddenly inſtructed men in the methods of raiſing Factions, and accuſtomed men with a kind of faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and dexterity in managing of them, and invited them to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of theſe practices by the ſweetneſs of power, and the ſucceſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93854:52"/>
of others that had prevailed by them.</p>
               <p>3. The third occaſion of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied Factions that happened in <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Dance began by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> was that very thing which was ordinarily uſed for the ſuppreſſing them; namely, the violence, rage, and revenge that was uſed by that Faction that prevailed, againſt the Faction that was ſubdued.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, When <hi>Marius</hi> was uppermoſt, he uſed all manner of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt <hi>Sylla</hi>'s party that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. Again, when <hi>Sylla</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he uſed the very like ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the party of <hi>Marius.</hi> The like was done again by <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cynna,</hi> and their party. Thus like fooliſh Paſſengers in a Boat, when the waves rowl, and the Boat tilts to one ſide, then run on the other, and make it tilt worſe; and then run again to the other ſide, till they endanger the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the Veſſel and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe great Heads of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93854:52"/>
and their parties, by the violent and outragious dealing with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed party, endeavouring thereby to ſecure and eſtabliſh themſelves in the free enjoyment of their acquired Victory and Greatneſs, and utterly to diſable the adverſe party ever to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again in power, did obtain a quite contrary effect, and ſuddenly ruine themſelves, and by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence give life to that party they thus endeavour by theſe means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh: And thus it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be, and in experience hath been commonly found to be; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. Theſe exceſſive ſeverities do raiſe in the generality of mankind theſe two paſſions, which do moſt ordinarily bring to paſs that which I have ſaid; namely, a loathing and deteſtation of that cruelty and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and of that party that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth it; and a pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards their fellow-Citizens, whom they ſee thus cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And that hatred doth moſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93854:53"/>
commonly waſte, and in time ruine the conquering party; and this pity doth ſecretly animate, aſſiſt, and buoy up the depreſſed party, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give it life, when it ſeems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed and dead.</p>
               <p>2. Theſe exceſſive ſeverities can never wholly extirpate all thoſe that are of the adverſe party; ſome will remain do what they can; And if they could wholly extirpate every perſon that ever appeared againſt them, yet it will be impoſſible to extirpate all their Relations or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, unleſs they ſhould wholly diſpeople their Countroy of all but themſelves. There is not a perſon that they murder, but it may be hath twenty others under ſome relation or other unto the perſon murdered, either as a Father, or Son, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Kindred, or Friend, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant. And the more of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party they deſtroy, the more Relations they leave that ſurvive them. And ſo many of the adverſe and ſuppreſſed party as are of their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93854:53"/>
relations, that ſurvive, will bear in mind the remembrance of that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and harbour a ſecret and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion of revenge againſt it: And this paſſion, as it is fierce, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and implacable, ſo it is vigilant and induſtrious to gain an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſatisfie it ſelf. And this was it that principally cauſed that Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all thoſe that adhered to him. It was not altogether the jealouſie they had of the Greatneſs of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the fear of his invading the Empire; but it was the memory of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and the death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities which he uſed againſt that party (though he were not immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate therein after the Battel ended.) The Love and Memory of <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Party that ſurvived him in his Friends and Relations, and the ſpirit of revenge that they had long harboured, was that which made and united, and fortified the Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And poſſibly the death of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> and the deſtruction of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93854:54"/>
by <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> might have produced as unhappy effects, had not the experience of <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> and his ſingular prudence and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his deſerved eſteem in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, conquered as well the revenge and envy of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Antonius</hi> his party. Thus theſe ſeverities of prevailing parties toò often times perpetuate and unite their enemies, inſtead of extirpating and extinguiſhing them.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth, and indeed the great cauſe of theſe Commotions at this time, and for ſo long a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, was this; States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths have certain periods of their duration and conſiſtency appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the ordinary methods of the Divine Providence; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe periods determine in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſolation or exciſion: Thus the Commonwealth of <hi>Carthage</hi> was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deſtroyed by the <hi>Roman.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this period doth not expire in a deſolation, but in ſome great change and alteration of it: And if the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93854:54"/>
and Fabrick of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be ſtrange and foreign, the change is more difficult; it hath a long and great ſtrugling before that change can be affected; and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the effecting thereof, there are ordinarily great aſpiring attempts endeavoured by great Spirits; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions and ſhakings antecedent and preliminary to it, as if the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection and temperature of the great and more regnant ſpirits in it, were tending to ſome ſuch change. And thus it fared with the State of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time; the period of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ariſtocratical and popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was within ſixty years of its end, and a new and better ſhape of Government to be aſſumed. And now all the great and active ſpirits in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeem to be reaching after a Monarchical or Imperial Government; as firſt, <hi>Marius,</hi> then <hi>Sylla,</hi> then <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then <hi>Antonius,</hi> then <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> And although all theſe were not able to acquire the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it, yet every one of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93854:55"/>
theſe drew nearer to Imperial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than the other; <hi>Sylla</hi>'s power grew greater than <hi>Marius</hi>'s; <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s than <hi>Sylla</hi>'s; <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s than <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s; till at laſt it fixed and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in <hi>Octavius Auguſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all theſe were ſo many indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that now at this time the Genius of the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick, or rather more truly, the Genius, the diſpoſition, temperament and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection of the <hi>Roman</hi> State was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards, and breathing after a Monarchy, as that which was now the moſt ſuitable Government for it; and that theſe ſeveral Earthquakes, raiſed by theſe fiery ſpirits, were but as ſo many ſtroaks of a skilful Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, to bring the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth into the more ſtately Statue and Configuration of an Imperial Government; which ſeemed now not only to be the complement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect growth and ſtature of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, but that which was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to preſerve it from ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine by Civil diſſentions, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93854:55"/>
its Grandeur; ſo that as the ſtate and condition of the natural Body arrives from a more imperfect degree, to a more perfect, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through various changes, till its complement and perfection; and then gradually declines: ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> State paſſed through theſe various forms, which in its ſeveral ſeaſons were ſuitable to it, till it came to this goodly and compleat ſtation whereunto it attained under <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</hi> And theſe various concuſſions and ſhakings that it had in thoſe ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> were but the preparatory endeavors, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and tendencies of the Spirit and Genius of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, that tended to it, and the ſtroaks and hammerings that were neceſſary for its effecting: And therefore this was the periodical ſeaſon for theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and preparations to a change. And thus far (by the way) of the Reaſons that might probably occaſion theſe Civil Broyls in the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth at this ſeaſon more than formerly.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning the Methods that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily perſons uſe to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Viciſsitudes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Factions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE have found <hi>Rome</hi> in the whole compaſs of the Life of <hi>Pomponius,</hi> to be a Theatre of great and tragical commotions, full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs and danger, and of various viciſſitudes; ſometimes one Faction prevailing, and ſometimes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faction being uppermoſt; and then again the former returning; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scene was oftentimes varied. And now I ſhall brieffy conſider of thoſe Methods that commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſe, and in that ſeaſon did uſe for their ſecurity and ſafety, and the errors and ineffectualneſs thereof, to the ends here propoſed, that thereby the prudence and wiſdom of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and the ſingular diſcretion of thoſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93854:56"/>
means which he uſed for his own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, may the more clearly appear. The means that ordinarily men chooſe in ſuch unquiet States, are for the moſt part ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They commonly ſtrike in with that Party or Faction that is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent power, and joyn with it, and commit their Fortunes into the ſame Veſſel with it; the imprudence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is apparent in this, that they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all in the conſtancy of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of that Party or Faction which they eſpouſe.</p>
               <p>And conſequently, if they prevail not, or happen to receive at any time a ſhock, they are ruined with them, or at leaſt eſcape that ruine with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difficulties. And herein is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent their want of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſtate of things of this nature. They judge according to the preſent face, and ſhew, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and do not conſider that truth which Reaſon and Experience makes evident and common; namely, that Factions in a State never long hold
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93854:57"/>
their ground. But if they are not ſuppreſſed by the natural power of the State wherein they ariſe, yet by the ſame like means whereby at any time they obtain, they are commonly broken and diſſolved, and by the ſame Artifices whereby they gain the Saddle, they are commonly unhorſed, either by the adverſe party, or by ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per riſing in their own Party, which is equally michievous to them. The Game being ordinarily thus managed, that when one Faction hath ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed another, the victorious Party fall into diviſions among themſelves; ſome thinking they have too ſmall a ſhare in the acqueſt, and others too much, and ſo weaken their Party, and render it leſs and narrower; and then commonly one of the ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded party, that finds it ſelf weakeſt, falls in with the remainders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the firſt party, and ſo oppreſs that ſubdivided party that laſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereby it comes to paſs, that if the perſon that fell in at firſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93854:57"/>
with the prevailing party, takes that ſubdivided party that ſeems prevalent, he ſuffers ruine with them; and if it be his Lot to fall in again with the weaker ſubdivided party, and ſo joyn with the old ſuppreſſed party, yet his former oppreſſion is remembred, and he is never truſted; and commonly as the old party gets advantage and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he is expoſed to Infamy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or loſs. But be the ſucceſs what it will be, he is ever in an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unſtable and tumultuous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtill put upon neceſſities of new Devices, Shifts and Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſave the State; whereby he never can enjoy true tranquillity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Life or Mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Expedient that men uſe to ſave themſelves, is, ever to be of the prevailing Faction by all Methods and Artifices imaginable, and as the parties change in their ſucceſſes, ſo to fall to them or from them: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have a difficult and troubleſom Game to play; and they had need be their Crafts-Maſter, if at the firſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93854:58"/>
change they are not at a loſs; but if they keep their ground upon the firſt change, they never can weather the ſecond; for they irrecoverably loſe their Credit; their tricks and ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and diſpoſition will be known, and then they will be like Stratagems in War, that can never be practiſed twice with any ſucceſs; at leaſt, by and between the ſame parties. And now theſe Artifices wherein men thus ſave themſelves, are commonly Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Diſſimulation, Pretenſions of their being formerly miſs-led, and now their eyes are opened, profeſſions of great ſatisfaction with the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the party prevailing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream indignation againſt that party which they formerly took; ſuing for opportunities to manifeſt their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them, and hatred of them; and to gain credit with their new Maſters, and give a teſtimony of their through converſion to them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their ſervice, and employing it in the bittereſt perſecutions, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and cruelties againſt thoſe that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93854:58"/>
they formerly ſerved. It is obſerved in the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> that when <hi>Antonius</hi> was declared an Enemy, and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> obtained in <hi>Rome,</hi> there were none more bitter perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Antony</hi>'s Family, than thoſe that in his proſperity had been his Friends: But the folly of theſe Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and followers of Fortune, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though poſſibly they may ſave their skins by ſuch tricks, yet they never gain credit enough with their new Friends to be either loved or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They may uſe them for their ends, but alwayes ſecretly hate and deteſt them, as men of baſe diſpoſitions and principles, and ever ſuſpect them, as ſuch as would do the like with their new Friends upon any turn of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their new Friends, if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them at all, employ them in the baſeſt Offices, and ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, though perchance uſeful to their occaſions, yet hateful and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to Humane Nature; as to be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93854:59"/>
Spies, Betrayers of thoſe that were of the former party, and ſuch ſordid employments: And they dare not boggle or ſcruple at ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, nor perform them perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily or ineffectually; for then they are rendred obnoxious to their new Maſters, and commonly ſuffer worſe than if they had never complied. And if they go through with theſe baſe employments, they are rendred odious to all good men; and if ever the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party gain ground again, they are ſure to be ruined: Thus they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their peace with their new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at the deareſt price, and become everlaſting ſlaves to ſave their Skins and Eſtates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Miſchief that they are involved in, is this; that if ever the former Faction prevail again, they are ſure to be dealt with worſe than the worſt of enemies, and can never ſave themſelves by new flatteries and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſations: Nay, if it fall out (as commonly it doth) that this laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faction breaks and ſubdivides
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93854:59"/>
into Factions, and one part falls in with the old Faction, to ſtrengthen themſelves, and carry this Sycophant along with them; yet the remaines of the old Faction will never forget this mans revolt; but one time or other, will work his ruine, unleſs his Fortune be better than either his Wiſdom or Deſert.</p>
               <p>3. Another, and the moſt ordinary help is upon the prevalence of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party, men that are obnoxious to them, purchaſe their peace, if they be rich and able: But this is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger too; for ſuch a man ſhall rarely ſit quiet under the party with whom he ſo compounded; but they will ever find ſome device to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes draining of Money from him; partly becauſe their neceſſities will be ſtill calling; and partly that they may diſable him from giving new ſupplies to the adverſe party, if ever they ſhould appear again. And if ever ſuch a Turn happen, he ſhall be ſure his old Friends will expect a greater contribution from him; and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93854:60"/>
make him pay a double Ranſom, (if he be able) to expiate his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer compoſition with their Enemies, and will pretend it a piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to ſet the higher Mulct upon him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe ordinary Helps whereby men uſe to ſecure themſelves under the Viciſſitudes of Factions: But theſe were not ſuch as were uſed by <hi>Atticus;</hi> they were quite of another kind, and ſuch as were more Noble, Prudent and Safe; as ſhall be ſeen when we come to conſider them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Touching the Means whereby the Safety of <hi>Atticus</hi> was procured under theſe various Viciſſitudes in the <hi>Roman</hi> State.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Hiſtory of this Mans Life gives us the Relation of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It gives us a ſhort and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Account of thoſe Storms and Civil Wars of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof I have given an Account ſomewhat more particularly in the firſt and ſecond Chapters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It gives us an Account how that notwithſtanding all theſe ſtorms, this man enjoyed a quiet and ſerene Life, and a peaceable Death, after he had lived 77 years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſhews alſo the Means which he uſed for the attaining of this Tranquillity of Eſtate, among all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93854:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe troubleſome Conteſts and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It alſo tells us of the excellent Learning, Virtue, Goodneſs, Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Frugality, Conſtancy, and other Excellencies of this excellent man.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, I have ſaid enough before: Touching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I ſhall ſay but little; becauſe the Hiſtory of his Life fully relates it. He alwayes in theſe times lived in great peace, quietneſs and tranquillity. 2. In great wealth and plenty. 3. In great eſteem and reverence with the Nobility and Common People of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. In great value and eſteem with all parties; no Faction, though never ſo prevalent or violent, did him any hurt; but ſtudied and endeavoured all wayes imaginable to oblige him; inſomuch that in his old age, his Daughter was married into the Family of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> 5. Which is yet more, he kept a fair and open, viſible correſpondence with all conteſting parties, even in the times when their differences and animoſities were higheſt, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93854:61"/>
any diſtaſte or jealouſie, by either party; all parties courting and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and eſteeming him in their greateſt heats, and conteſts, and civil wars one againſt another. Indeed upon the return of <hi>Anthony</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> this good man began to be ſomewhat afraid of Proſcription; this fear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued him by reaſon partly of his old Age, which naturally is more obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to Fear, than younger Age; and partly by reaſon of that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and violence uſed againſt <hi>Cicero</hi> his intimate Friend: But it ſoon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was more afraid than he had cauſe; for <hi>Antonius</hi> did not only give him an aſſurance of his own ſafety, but at his interceſſion, ſpared many more, that had otherwiſe been obnoxious to the danger of this revolution. In ſhort, he lived as happy and as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a life as could poſſibly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt ſerene and quiet times.</p>
               <p>Touching the fourth of theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Virtues of this excellent man, I have occaſion to mention them in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93854:62"/>
next Chapter. And the Buſineſs of all the following Diſcourſe ſhall be principally employed in the third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; namely, the Means and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods whereby this excellent man was preſerved in the midſt of theſe Civil Flames and Storms. And next under the Divine Providence (which ſecretly and powerfully ordereth and governeth all things and events in the world) I think the preſervation of this excellent man, may be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt place, to the Virtue and Prudence of <hi>Atticus</hi> himſelf; and ſecondly, to the Temper and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time, and of the Nobility and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens thereof.</p>
               <p>And becauſe my great Deſign in all this Diſcourſe is to trace out thoſe excellencies, and that prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Atticus</hi> herein. I reſerve the firſt of theſe to the full enquiry of the enſuing Chapters, and ſhall take up the ſecond Conſideration, which as it was the leaſt of the Conducibles
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93854:62"/>
to his preſervation; ſo it ſhall be but briefly handled.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be in the condition of Affairs and Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe two Expedients, that, though to an ordinary perſon, they might be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe in theſe Calamities; yet to a man of that eminent worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deſert that was in this man, might be ſome aſſiſtance to his own prudent conduct of affairs in relation to his ſafety and preſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The experience that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State had gained of the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of things before ſuch time as <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Athens:</hi> For he went to <hi>Athens</hi> about the time of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s firſt return to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marius,</hi> he returned not till after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Death, as it ſeems, And though that after his return, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Viciſſitudes thereof in <hi>Rome,</hi> were great; yet I think ſcarce any Hiſtory gives an account of ſo great Troubles, and Viciſſitudes, and Changes in ſo ſhort a time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſingle Heads of Factions,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93854:63"/>
as happened between <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi> And this inſtability and viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things gave a Leſſon to enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Factions, of ſome more modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than appeared between thoſe two parties of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla;</hi> and therefore it ſeems that in Conteſts between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> there was ſomewhat more of moderation, than was between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius.</hi> But this was ſoon forgotten (I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) for the aſſaſſination of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party, ſoon made both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties forget moderation, as appears by the cruelty of <hi>Antonius</hi> againſt <hi>Cicero</hi> and divers others at his return to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſomething conducible to the quiet of <hi>Atticus,</hi> namely, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that all parties had of the viciſſitude of Fortune, taught them ſomewhat more of Moderation than formerly; and men engaged in Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were contented to keep an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in ſo good and worthy a man as <hi>Atticus;</hi> though he took not part with them; becauſe they knew not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93854:63"/>
how ſoon they might ſtand in need of his Friendſhip, either to relieve their diſtreſſed condition, or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond Conſideration relating to the Great men, and chief Officers, and Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> was this, that long and great experience had given them a great obſervation and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men and their diſpoſitions and worth. <hi>Athens</hi> indeed was then the greateſt School in the world, for the attaining of the knowledge of Learning and Arts; but there was no School in the world equal to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the knowledge of men. For they had the beſt opportunity to have the experience of this kind by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converſe with men of all diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, inclinations, employments, and Nations, both in the reſort of Foreign Agents thither, and in their own Negotiations and Expeditions abroad, and the great variety of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and actions, and occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſeveral natures. Theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities taught, eſpecially the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93854:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> admirably well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand men as well as buſineſs.</p>
               <p>And they found that <hi>Atticus</hi> was not only a very learned, wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man (this indeed had not been ſufficient to have protected him no more than it did <hi>Cicero)</hi> but that he was a man of great eſteem, and well beloved by the Citizens general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and a man that really and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely declined any intermedling with any Faction, did not ſtand in the way of that Honour and Grandeur that ambitious men looked after; that he was contented with his Station, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not Power nor Wealth, that his beneficence was great to all, and not out of contemplation or ſtudy of parties, but as a friend to Humane Nature and Mankind in general. And upon this account, they found that it was not at all their intereſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the neceſſity of their Affairs engage the Victorious Faction to bend themſelves againſt him; nay they well knew it would have been a diſreputation to their Cauſe, to have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93854:64"/>
oppreſſed a man of that credit and innocence that <hi>Atticus</hi> was of. And beſides, they found, that as the ſtate of all affairs was ſo mutable, that ſometimes one party, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was uppermoſt, ſo he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magazine and Treaſury of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and beneficence to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and exigences of Mankind, though he induſtriouſly declined cheriſhing or encouraging their Factions and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities. And they prudently fore ſaw a poſſibility of the change of their own condition, wherein they might ſtand in need of his Beneficence hereafter; and therefore not only out of Juſtice, in contemplation of his Innocence, but out of Prudence, in contemplation of the mutability of things, and the uſe they might have of his relief and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence upon a change of Affairs, they did not only not oppreſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him; but they endeavoured by all offices of kindneſs and reſpect, to oblige him. And hence it was, that although the great Heads of Factions, when they prevailed, were ſevere to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93854:65"/>
all that oppreſſed them, and jealous of all that were not of their party, were ready to receive occaſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and enriched themſelves, and gratified their Aſſiſtants with the ſpoils of all ſuch as they ſuſpected: Yet they would receive no accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him, and generouſly did bear with the reliefs he gave to their Enemies in diſtreſs; and interpreted it not as an adhering to the adverſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to be, as indeed it was, the fruit of his natural beneficence and goodneſs to Mankind, as ſuch. And therefore they were not of ſuch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and pitiful ſouls, to give ear to buſie Informers or Sycophants againſt a man of his worth and goodneſs, as one that ſtrictly ſided with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party, or that his beneficence towards men in diſtreſs was an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or eſpouſing of their Follies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: For they underſtood and knew the man to be wiſe, and juſt, and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, though liberal and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to thoſe that wanted. And this was another occaſion of his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93854:65"/>
namely, the prudence and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thoſe great men, who, though by reaſon of their Self-Love, Intereſt, Ambition, Affectation of Power, and Greatneſs of Spirit, and emulation, could brook no Opponent or Rival in their Greatneſs; yet had ſo much wiſdom as to know men; and ſo much generoſity and nobleneſs of mind, as to value and eſteem ſuch a one who was really a common Friend and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor to Humane Nature. And theſe be ſome of thoſe foreign and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental contributions to his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But all theſe are but little and inconſiderable. The great foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſafety (next under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs and Providence) were his own Worth, Virtue, Goodneſs, Prudence and wiſe Conduct of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his actions, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, as the Author of his Life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>ſuae ipſius Fortunae Opifex,</hi> one that moulded and ſhaped his own ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and happineſs through the whole courſe of his Life.</p>
               <p>And this is the buſineſs and deſign
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93854:66"/>
of the enſuing Diſcourſe, namely, to ſhew thoſe excellent, wiſe and honeſt Methods whereby he ſerved the great ſuperintendent Providence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, in his own preſervation and ſteering of his Life in peace and happineſs through all the Storms and Tempeſts of that troubled State of <hi>Rome,</hi> till he arrived at his reſt in a good old Age. And this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I ſhall proſecute at large in the enſuing Chapters, as the principal end of this Diſcourſe. 1. Becauſe it may give a more diſtinct account of the admirable Prudence and Wiſdom of this excellent man. 2. Becauſe it will give a ſingular example, and poſſibly a uſeful inſtruction how a man may preſerve at once himſelf and his innocence and tranquillity in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and tumultuous times, and ſteer himſelf between the Rocks of conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Factions without Shipwrack.</p>

                  <p>Touching the Means that <hi>Pomponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Atticus</hi> uſed to ſave himſelf from the dangers of the Civil Wars that happened in <hi>Rome:</hi> And firſt, concerning the Quality and Condition of the Man himſelf.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Means that this excellent man uſed for his preſervation, were not of thoſe low and deſpicable kinds that are before mentioned in the Third Chapter; but they were ſuch as are honeſt and generous, juſtifiable and rational; ſuch as conſiſted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, worth and prudence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly proved ſingularly ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well to preſerve his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as his Safety.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall digeſt them under theſe three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What he was, and how the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93854:67"/>
qualifications and condition of his perſon conduced to this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What he principally avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What he principally did in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this attainment. And in all theſe, I ſhall follow that faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of him and his Life, by his Contemporary <hi>Cornelius Nepos;</hi> though I ſhall perchance order and tranſpoſe the ſeveral circumſtances and paſſages in it, in ſome different order from that Deſcription, ſingling out, and laying together the ſame under vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heads or Sections.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe; what he was: He was a man of deſerved veneration and eſteem where-ever he lived; and that eſteem obtained not by a bare, light, popular eye; but raiſed upon the firmeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving accounts, ariſing in or from himſelf, or thoſe acceſſions or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions that were of great vicinity to himſelf; ſo that he had a kind of intrinſick propriety in the reputation he had; becauſe it was but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93854:67"/>
reflection of what was his own: and not from the Donatives, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or liberality of others. By this means his honour and eſteem became fixed, ſtable and permanent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though he were not of a <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Race, yet he was of a generous Extraction and Family, derived to him by a long ſucceſſion of Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Equeſtrian</hi> Degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He had a fair Eſtate deſcended to him from his Father, which was encreaſed by the acceſſion he had from his Unkle; and this he encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by great Offices, or Military Rapine, Farming of Cuſtoms, or by Merchandize, or by any Mechanical employments, but by a prudent and generous Frugality, ſavouring neither of parſimony, nor profuſeneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was educated in all ſorts of Learning, firſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> and after at <hi>Athens,</hi> the University of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He had perſons of great eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Learning, that were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his Education.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93854:68"/>
5. He made a great proficiency in all kinds of Learning, as <hi>Greek</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Poetry, Antiquities and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; in all which he exceeded his Contemporaries.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He was a man of exquiſite parts, of a great Wit, profound Judgment, admirable Elocution, ſingular Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All theſe he improved by uſe and experience in matters of publick concernment, whereof he was a great obſerver; and though he would not meddle as a publick Officer; yet he much aſſiſted the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens</hi> with his private advice and aſſiſtance in the buſineſſes of the Commonwealth; and after his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was looked upon as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe man in State-Affairs; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that if he would have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf in publick Councils, he had been able probably at any time to have weighed more than any one man, the publick Counſels and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that State.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He was a man of great Truth,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93854:68"/>
Veracity and Sincerity, that hated Lying and Flattery.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He was a man of ſingular Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Domeſtick Affairs, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal without Parſimony or Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Houſe and Furniture neat and handſom, without Sumptuouſneſs, his Family great, but orderly; his entertainments plentiful, without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He had a great proſpect into the Affairs both private and publick, and could at a diſtance foreſee the events of things. <hi>Tully,</hi> that was a wiſe man, conſulted him as his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and had he followed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or Example of <hi>Atticus,</hi> he had eſcaped the violence of <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. He was a man of a large heart, liberal, bountiful, compaſſionate to thoſe in want, diſtreſs, or neceſſity, and yet placed his bounty with that wiſdom, that he avoided the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Popularity, and the danger of countenancing Factions or Parties; and this he did by theſe two methods, he did what he did in this kind, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93854:69"/>
and generouſly, not ſneakingly, as if he was aſhamed or afraid of what he did; and he did it indifferently, and without diſcrimination of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He was a man of great affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and cherfulneſs, and yet mingled with ſuch authority and gravity, that as by the former he gained Love, ſo by the latter he upheld his Reſpect and Reverence; that as my Author tells us, it was hard to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was more feared, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, or loved. He conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the meaneſt with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom condeſcention, and yet loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his awe and due diſtance; and he correſponded with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt without adulation or flattery; with the meaneſt, without ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or inſolence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe many qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lificationns of this man, that rendred him acceptable to all, beloved of all, reverenced and eſteemed by all; ſo that none would or durſt do him hurt: all courted his Friendſhip and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93854:69"/>
And by that excellent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and goodneſs, and ſuitableneſs of diſpoſition to the true <hi>Genius</hi> of Humane Nature, he obtained a ſecret intereſt and party, as it were, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man; for although moſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind be tranſported either with paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ambition, or ſelf-love, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whereby they are carried out to many unruly and diſorderly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet there is in every man a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Genius</hi> of Humanity, a ſecret by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs towards Virtue and Goodneſs, that a man can never ſo far forth put off and diſcharge himſelf from, but that he will ſtill retain an approbation of Virtue and Goodneſs, a ſecret eſteem of it, and of them that practiſe and uſe it; though mens Paſſions and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Incogitancy may carry them off from the practice of it themſelves; ſo that the common byaſs and ſecret ſympathy of the humane Nature in all men with Virtue, Goodneſs and Honeſty, gives an honeſt and a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man intereſt almoſt in the worſt of men, whereby they are before they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93854:70"/>
are aware, inclined to love, reverence and honour him, whom yet their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intereſt many times forbid to imitate. And this goodneſs of <hi>Atticus</hi> was that which gave unto him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intereſt and party, as it were, in thoſe rough, great and ambitious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Officers, and all others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that they durſt not injure him, but loved, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired him as a man framed according to the true Standard of the Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>And as this connatural benignity of this man was the root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all thoſe excellent actions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned, which were thoſe other Auxillaries that procured his ſafety, ſo I do look upon that native and acquired worth, virtue, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and congruity to humane perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that deſerved eſteem and honour that from thence reſulted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the generality of men, to be one of the greateſt procurers of his ſecurity in troubled times. And indeed upon the bare account of his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93854:70"/>
worth, wiſdom and excellence, I do look upon him as a greater man than <hi>Sylla,</hi> or great <hi>Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf: For theſe great men being circled about with great Armies, with Horſemen and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, with Swords and Pikes, and other inſtruments of force and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſubdued and conquered Cities, and Kingdoms, and Armies, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhattered and broke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with theſe aſſiſtances ruled the Senate, the City, the People; but this ſingle man, without either Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or Military power, or external force, without any Inſtruments of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, by his own perſonal virtue, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worth, commanded the love and eſteem of all, prevented injuries, conquered the Conquerors, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them all ſucceſſively, one after another, when they were in their greateſt ſplendor and power, to court him, to ſtrive to oblige him, to pay an awful reverence to him; ſo that he was in truth greater than the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them, and better fortified and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93854:71"/>
guarded againſt the common violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attended thoſe times, than either <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in the midſt of their greateſt and moſt formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the other Expedients that this wiſe man uſed, to avoid the difficulties of the Times wherein he lived; and firſt, of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the former Chapter we have ſeen <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> an excellent, good and virtuous man, and in great eſteem by reaſon thereof, where-ever he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the great ſecurity he had upon that account of the great reverence and veneration that all men owed and paid to him: And this was the great <hi>Baſis</hi> both of his ſecurity and tranquillity in troubled and factious
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93854:71"/>
times, and the root and ſpring of all thoſe virtuous actions and prudent management of his Life, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reverence and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his worth, contributed to his ſafety and happineſs of Life.</p>
               <p>Theſe actions and prudent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals I have before diſtributed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to their Objects, into theſe two kinds.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The things which he avoided.</item>
                  <item>2. The things which he did.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The firſt Eſſay that he made, was to avoid the Scene of the troubled eſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a wiſe foreſight of the enſuing commotions, and the difficulty for him, being young, rich, and in eſteem, to avoid, if he ſtaid in <hi>Rome,</hi> engagement in thoſe dangerous Factions that were now hatching, and partly broken out: And for that purpoſe he retired with a conſiderable part of his perſonal Eſtate, to <hi>Athens.</hi> And this he did principally to avoid thoſe growing Storms which were beginning; but yet with a fair and worthy deſign to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93854:72"/>
improve himſelf in Learning at <hi>Athens,</hi> which was the learnedeſt School in the world, and the place of reſort of young Gentlemen, not only of <hi>Greece,</hi> but of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for their education: And the manner and occaſion of this his withdrawing from <hi>Rome,</hi> was thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius</hi> became a great man in <hi>Rome,</hi> had been now ſix times Conſul, a man of an active, buſie, fierce and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirit, and projected great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in affairs to the detriment of the Senate and Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by his often holding the Magiſtracy, had gotten many active Spirits of his party, among which was <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> though privately and cautiouſly, and many other Gentlemen of Spirit and Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomponius</hi> lived all this time in <hi>Rome,</hi> being bred there in the time of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s power, and bred up with one of his Sons, and with divers Gentlemen that could not chooſe but be devoted to the party of <hi>Marius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93854:72"/>
In the ſixth Conſulate of <hi>Marius,</hi> he began to be almoſt of mans eſtate, about 18 years old, the ſeaſon for young Gentlemen of <hi>Rome</hi> to mingle themſelves in publick Affairs, or to be initiated in Military Employment; and doubtleſs he could not chooſe but be ſolicited and importuned thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to about that Age, and could hardly avoid it without an imputation of ſluggiſhneſs and cowardize, or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no friend to the preſent State of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the rather becauſe he was known to be rich, and Nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
               <p>And beſides all this, he was linked into affinity and acquaintance with many of the party of <hi>Marius,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with <hi>Sulpicius</hi> the Tribune, a great Friend of <hi>Marius,</hi> whoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married his Siſter.</p>
               <p>And now the Senate and Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> ſmarting under the power of <hi>Marius,</hi> and deſirous to avoid his Inſolence, ſolicited <hi>Sylla</hi> to return to <hi>Rome</hi> for their deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> returns with his Army, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93854:73"/>
being oppoſed by the power of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> overcomes them, kills <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> baniſheth <hi>Marius,</hi> and ſits heavy upon the party of <hi>Marius,</hi> with Death, Confiſcation and Baniſhment, as hath been before ſhewn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomponius</hi> finding the buſineſs to grow warm and dangerous, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the encreaſe of troubles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now about 19 or 20 years old, and having an handſom and juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and opportunity to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> to improve his Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, takes the opportunity; and in the interval of the domination of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and poſſibly foreſeeing a probability of the party of <hi>Marius</hi> to engage <hi>Rome</hi> in new Troubles, repairs to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and there he ſtayes for about eight years; and as it ſeems, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond Return and Death of <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this handſom retirement, he gains theſe two advantages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The opportunity of his encreaſe in Learning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The declining and avoiding the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93854:73"/>
Storms at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the neceſſity of being ſome way unhappily engaged in one of the parties, or cruſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both; and yet the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the former, namely, his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable going to <hi>Athens</hi> for the acqueſt of Learning, according to the cuſtom of young Gentlemen of that Age and time, fairly covered his latter deſign of avoiding the troubleſome concerns of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, and was a juſt and reaſonable excuſe for his retreat thence, though there had been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe.</p>
               <p>So that herein the Wiſdom of this young man appears; namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In chooſing ſuch a ſeaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from <hi>Rome,</hi> when it was not ſafe for a young Gentleman to remain there, unleſs he would vainly hazard all by engaging in a Faction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In chooſing ſuch a ſeaſon of his Age; namely, about twenty years; and ſuch a place for his retirement, as was proper for his advance in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and carried his apology with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93854:74"/>
it, and avoided all juſt cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception by either party.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhall ſay it was a piece of puſillanimity for him then to retire, when his Countrey ſtood in need of his advice, aſſiſtance and countenance. It is eaſily anſwered, The whole City was then divided into thoſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; if he had gone about to have appeared againſt both, it had been vain and ridiculous, and utterly inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; he had imprudently loſt his Labour, and expoſed himſelf inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be ruined by both: or either had he ſtood ſingle in ſuch oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every man would juſtly have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed him a Fool; and had he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged others in ſuch an oppoſition, he had ruined his Friends and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants as well as himſelf; which had not only been vain, but alſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to have involved others in ſo fruitleſs and deſperate an Enterprize. But on the other ſide, had he fallen in with either Faction, he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have been carried with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent torrent of the Faction wherein
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93854:74"/>
he was engaged, either in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oppoſition of his Countrey, and the Cruelties which they uſed againſt their Opponents, if they prevailed; or muſt needs have ſunk in the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that party, if they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: So that his retirement in this ſeaſon, was an act of great prudence; becauſe unleſs he had ſo done, he had no pretence, conſidering his youth and eminence, to avoid the intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one Faction, or the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate oppoſition of both, if he had ſtaid: But afterwards in that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then near ſixty years old, kept his Station in <hi>Rome</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, having the fair excuſe of his old Age, to apologize againſt engagement with either. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the firſt Specimen of his Prudence, his ſeaſonable and juſtifiable retirement to <hi>Athens</hi> in his youth, when Factions grew violent, and chuſing that time and place for his quiet improvement of Learning, which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93854:75"/>
he might with moſt opportunity and ſafety dedicate to that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93854:75"/>
of avoiding Engagement in any Factions. In order thereunto, was that Expedient mentioned in the former Chapter; namely, his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I ſhall conſider the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution thereof in relation to thoſe importunities that were uſed to engage him in parties after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Rome,</hi> and even while he was in <hi>Athens;</hi> and ſhall make theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations touching it, that may be uſeful in relation to it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pomponius</hi> was at <hi>Athens, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> reſorted to him, there preſented him with Gifts, complemented him, and uſed all methods to endear him. And this he did for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Out of the great reſpect and honour that he bore to his Learning and worth; this was fair and noble, and became ſuch a man as <hi>Sylla</hi> was, who was a great Lover of Learning. But this was not all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Therefore <hi>Sylla</hi> being now engaged againſt the party of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93854:76"/>
                  <hi>Marius,</hi> and now about to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon that Deſign, thought that it would be an advantage to him and his proceeding, if he could but publickly poſſes the World with an opinion of a great familiarity and intimacy between himſelf and <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who was a perſon of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation, not only at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> but at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the news would quickly fly thither touching the great kindneſs between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Pomponius,</hi> and this would quickly beget an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Pomponius</hi> was won over to his party; that <hi>Sylla</hi> communicated his Counſels to him, and uſed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and that all the courſes he ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were guided by <hi>Atticus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; and then the veneration that all perſons had of <hi>Pomponius</hi> and his Wiſdom, would give a great credit to his undertaking, when once the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were poſſeſſed of that great intimacy and dearneſs between him and <hi>Sylla.</hi> And beſides it was well known, that although <hi>Pomponius</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93854:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Marius,</hi> or any other; yet he he had many Friends and Relations in that party; and ſuch a report would give a great diſcouragement to that party: And this is no ſtrange piece of policy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> when he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhewed all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Relations and Poſſeſſions of thoſe men in <hi>Rome,</hi> that he moſt feared; thereby to poſſeſs the people with a jealouſie of them, that they were of his party, or with a greater kindneſs to himſelf, that he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe the people honoured. And it hath been an uſual trick in times of publick differences, that when U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers or the heads of any Factions were about any pernicious or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous action, they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the propalation of ſuch buſineſſes, ſend for perſons of greateſt reputation and credit, and poſſibly thoſe that they knew to be greatly in credit with the adverſe party, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs them, entertain private converſe and ſpeech with them, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of ſome idle impertinent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93854:77"/>
as of a Horſe-Race, or Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Match, and then preſently after, publiſh, or go about ſome pernicious action, that the world might think to be the product of ſome advice from thoſe perſons whom they thus enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And this was another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Sylla</hi> maintained this great familiarity with <hi>Atticus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> that the world might think that ſurely he was now of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s party, and that they had communicated counſels each with other, for the farther advance of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s undertakings.</p>
               <p>3. It reſted not here; <hi>Sylla</hi> being a great man, and having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Aſia</hi> aſſigned to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Athens</hi> lay, uſed all theſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to <hi>Atticus,</hi> to ſee whether he could really draw him over unto him; and having, as he thought, prepared him with ſo great applications, and addreſſes, and familiarity, from ſo great a man as himſelf then was, thought that now it might be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to perſwade him to go along with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in plain terms
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93854:77"/>
to be of his party; but he was not only diſappointed herein, but by the overacting of this part, he loſt all that advantage which he might have gained by the former policy, namely, to have perſwaded the world by that great intercourſe between them, that <hi>Atticus</hi> was ſecretly at leaſt, of his Faction. When <hi>Sylla</hi> therefore a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his going from <hi>Athens,</hi> plainly broke his mind to <hi>Atticus,</hi> and perſwaded him to go along with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> he gave him the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory, yet reaſonable Anſwer: <hi>Noli adverſum eos me velle ducere cum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ne contra te arma ferrem,</hi> Italiam <hi>rebiqui:</hi> Perſwade me not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; for I left <hi>Italy,</hi> that I might not bear arms with them againſt thee. <hi>Sylla,</hi> though he loſt his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and Deſign, yet outwardly, at leaſt, appeared ſatisfied with the reaſonableneſs and juſtneſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, gave him fair reſpects at his departure from <hi>Athens,</hi> and returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he gave another turn
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93854:78"/>
of things, and quite routed the party of <hi>Marius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when <hi>Pompey</hi> was in his great power, and upon the difference between him and <hi>Caſar,</hi> marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caſar,</hi> with the Vote and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the Senate and the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>Atticus</hi> now in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhewed him all private and friendly reſpect, yet he would by no means be drawn to follow <hi>Pompey</hi> into the Field, or to intereſs himſelf into the Concern of that Faction; but fairly excuſed himſelf by reaſon of his Age, being then about threeſcore. This <hi>Caſar</hi> interpreted to his advantage (though he would moſt certainly have given the like Anſwer to him, had <hi>Caſar</hi> had the like opportunity of the like requeſt) yet I ſay <hi>Caeſar</hi> took it kindly, and was willing, for his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit's ſake, to interpret it to his own advantage; and therefore when he returned Victor over <hi>Pompey,</hi> he did not only ſpare <hi>Atticus</hi> (though he ſtaid at <hi>Rome)</hi> from any ſuch thing as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or Confiſcation (the eaſieſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93854:78"/>
animadverſion that the Victors uſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their enemies) but excuſed him from that Mulct or Fine that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon Neuters. Yea, he did not only ſpare him from any thing of puniſhment, but uſed him with all the humanity and reſpect imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Again, when <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and their party baſely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in the Senate, and <hi>Brutus</hi> was thereupon raiſed up, not only by the party of <hi>Pompey,</hi> as the <hi>Vindex Pompeiani ſanguinis,</hi> but by the Generality of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of their Liberty; that as the firſt <hi>Brutus</hi> delivered them from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kings, ſo the ſecond <hi>Brutus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued them from the power of a King, under the name of a <hi>Perpetual Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> and the Senate and People mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified him, as the great Aſſertor of their Liberty: I ſay, when <hi>Brutus</hi> rid upon this triumphant Chariot of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Applauſes, there was a ſecret deſign on foot for the raiſing of a private Bank or Treaſury for <hi>Brutus,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93854:79"/>
the Head of this Commonwealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, and the deſign was laid that it ſhould be done by a Subſcription; and thoſe of the <hi>Equestrian</hi> Order ſhould be the firſt Subſcribers: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of this Advice, knowing <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> to be rich, liberal, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and therefore that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample would be of great authority: They thought to begin with him, and that his Name ſhould be the firſt in the Subſcription-Roll, but they were deceived: <hi>Atticus</hi> plainly told them, that although <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhould command his Purſe, as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the relief of his perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies, as he had often done before; yet he would by no means meddle in ſuch an Enterprize, which ſavoured ſo much of an engagement in a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a publick owning of a party; and thereupon the Deſign broke, and was no further proſecuted. And this was no ſmall occaſion of his ſafety and preſervation, and alſo of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſteem, when the Tide of affairs turned, and <hi>Anthony</hi> returned
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93854:79"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> victorious againſt <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by all theſe and many more indications of this kind, <hi>Atticus</hi> made it evident to all men, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt any engagement in any Faction; and this gave him that great ſecurity and priviledge, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he relieved any of any Faction, it was not with any contemplation of their party or Faction; but as I have often ſaid, upon the common account of reſpect to Humane Nature, and a certain native <hi>Philanthropy</hi> to Mankind in general: and again, when he reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied any ſuch action or thing as might be juſtly conſtrued an eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Faction, yet he was not thereby obnoxious to the indignation of that party that he ſo refuſed, he did but <hi>ſolitum obtinere,</hi> kept his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and did equally and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject the ſolicitations of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this kind; and hereby he ſtood upon his own <hi>Baſis</hi> and bottom, kept his ſtation, was neither ingaged in any Faction, nor was he rendred thereby obnoxious to the indignation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93854:80"/>
of the parties which he thus refuſed, though they were in power, and able to do what they pleaſed; becauſe they found by experience, he did but hold his Principle, and was impartial therein, equally refuſing other Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as theirs.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſons that moved him to this kind of neutrality in Factions, are evident, and may be ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He did it upon an account of greateſt Prudence; for it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to him by great experience, and by a wiſe proſpect of things, that theſe Factions and their ſucceſſes were ſtrangely mutable and uncertain. Our Author tells us, <hi>Tanta variet as iis temporibus fuit Fortunae, ut modò hi, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò illi in ſummo eſſent faſtigio aut peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo:</hi> The ſucceſſes of Factions were ſo uncertain, and the viciſſitudes ſo ſtrange and various, that thoſe that now prevailed, and ſeemed in an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable condition, were ſuddenly tumbled down; and again, thoſe that ſeemed in an irrecoverable and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93854:80"/>
ruine, regained the Government, even to a Miracle. And the Reaſons are partly given in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore by engaging in any Faction, he was ſure to undergo the common Fate which that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had; which was either wholly to be ruined, if the adverſe party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, or at beſt, in caſe the party wherein he ſhould be engaged, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, yet they were but in a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, uncertain, unquiet, reſtleſs condition, and were not like to hold that power or intereſt which they had ſo difficultly gotten.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He did it upon account of common Juſtice and Honeſty; for thoſe Factions in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not the true, lawful, ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof: For therein <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> and all good men ought to have engaged; for it had been their duty and glory to have aſſiſted it, and a certain baſeneſs and puſillanimity of mind to have deſerted: But thoſe Factions in <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſuch as I have before deſcribed in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93854:81"/>
certain Excreſcencies, Tumors, and Diſeaſes ariſing in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, by the Power, Ambition and unquiet Spirits of certain buſie men in <hi>Rome,</hi> that either thought their Worth neglected, or not ſufficiently rewarded, or were provoked to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities by mutual Jealouſies and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations one of another. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is true in the ſeveral Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of the prevalence of any Faction, they did ſo handle the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and People by Artifices, and Tricks, and Threats, and Affrights, that they minted their Factions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes with the ſtamp and face of the Senate and publick Authority; yet the truth was, they were really ſtill no other than Factions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which like prevalent noxious Humors, or putrefied Diſtempers in the Body, overpowered the true State and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rendred the whole Body in Diſorder; yet it could be no more eſteemed the true complection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, than a <hi>Fever</hi> or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93854:81"/>
                  <hi>Calenture,</hi> though it overſpread the whole man, can be accounted the true and natural complexion of the man: And although the <hi>Paroxyſmes</hi> or Fits that the <hi>Roman</hi> State was put into, were various, and contrary each to other, according as one or the other prevailed; like the hot Fit and the cold Fit in an Ague; yet ſtill the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſick, and laboured under the Diſtemper of either Faction, which ſoever of them prevailed, as the Hiſtories of thoſe Times abundantly inform us.</p>
               <p>And therefore all thoſe ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as they were extreamly cruel and ſevere unto one another, ſo they were all infinitely pernicious to the Commonwealth; which by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of thoſe turbulent Spirits, was torn in pieces. And therefore <hi>Atticus</hi> in common Juſtice, and upon the account of that Love he owed and bore to his Countrey, had no reaſon to joyn with one or other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which were in truth, but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Cancers,</hi> and <hi>Ulcers,</hi> and Diſeaſes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93854:82"/>
of his Countrey; which though they were too ſtrong for him to cure, yet he had no reaſon to aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>I do confeſs that commonly all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to gain themſelves credit, at leaſt make ſome pretence for the good of their Countrey, ſomething that they would pretend to reform. And it may be, really there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was neceſſary to be reformed, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order might be ſo powerful, ſtubborn, and obſtinate, that they thought it could not be done by ordinary means, and that at the firſt attempt might be the thing that they, or at leaſt many of them really, and it may be, only, or at leaſt principally aimed to ſet right: But <hi>Atticus</hi> was a wiſe man, and did eaſily ſee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That many times Reformation was pretended, but the great Deſign was private Intereſt, or Revenge. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If ſome men in the ſimplicity of their hearts, meant well to the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> that were engaged in thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93854:82"/>
Factions; yet when once a Faction is ſet on foot, men that have other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, either of Ambition, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, mingle in it, and commonly in a little time, become prevalent, and diſtort all to their private Ends and Advantages, and engage others in the like, who are fed, or do feed themſelves with the like Hopes. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. He well knew that in a little proceſs of time, variety, ſucceſſion, and occurrences, and new emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Counſels carry Factions quite beyond their firſt Deſigns into greater Rapine, Fury, and Cruelty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, than ever they themſelves, it may be, at firſt thought they ſhould ever have been guilty of.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Experience that <hi>Atticus</hi> had of the prodigious Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Bloodſhed, and Rapine and Violence that former Factions had produced in <hi>Rome,</hi> made him peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory againſt engaging in any, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their moſt ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and earneſt importunities to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93854:83"/>
engage him; for he well knew that if he ſhould be engaged in any, yet had it obtained the beſt ſucceſs that they could reaſonably expect, namely, Victory, and a full enjoyment and poſſeſſion of the power they deſired, yet the rage and exaſperation of the Souldiery, the deſire of revenge of thoſe injuries the conquering party had formerly ſuffered, the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of enriching themſelves by the ſpoils and confiſcation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the neceſſity of gratifying many neceſſitous and indigent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their party, the politick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure themſelves in their new acquired power, by the death and ruine of all ſuch whom they knew, or feared, or ſuſpected, were, or might be their Oppoſites, and the ſtriving to eſtabliſh themſelves againſt any poſſibility of falling under the power of thoſe that they had injured; theſe, I ſay, and ſuch as theſe, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently engage the victorious party to exerciſe all cruelty and violence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations and proſcriptions, death and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93854:83"/>
murder upon thoſe they hated, or feared, or injured, or ſuſpected: And all this <hi>Atticus</hi> muſt behold, and not be able in the leaſt degree to help; and ſo his firſt engagement into this party, though victorious, muſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs him in all the villanies, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and unjuſtneſs that muſt be the fruit of this ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>In the firſt motion of Enterprizes of this nature, the pretences are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fair, modeſt, nothing pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but reformation of abuſes, and great moderation profeſſed; and this is ſo carried by the Heads of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly to cover their Deſigns, partly to gain to themſelves credit and good eſteem with good men, or at leaſt with the Vulgar, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Heads of parties may with the more eaſe and plauſibility attain their deſired ſucceſs: Yea, it may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Heads of parties might in their firſt attempts really intend what they at firſt pretended. But when the ſucceſs is attained, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by great Bloodſhed, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93854:84"/>
of Factions quickly outgo the ends and deſigns at firſt propounded. New ſucceſſes give new reſolutions, new deſigns, new attempts, which before either were not diſcovered, or it may be, not thought on by the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers in their firſt undertaking. And <hi>Atticus</hi> well knew, that if once he was engaged in the Enterprize, he muſt follow not only the Fortune, but alſo the Commands and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the party and their Governors, and ſo be engaged in all the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Injuſtice that attended their ſucceſs, and ſo loſe his innocence: Or if he ſhould go about to declaim and proteſt againſt the unjuſt proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Succeſſes, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſiſt them, his endeavour might be his ruine; but at the beſt, could never be prevalent or ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the beſt fruit he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from his Engagement in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would be repentance too dearly bought, the loſs of his Credit, if not of his Innocence, the ſad ſpectacle of the violence and injuſtice of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93854:84"/>
wherein he thus had unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged, and a miſerable deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſappointment in all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reclaim it, or reſtrain thoſe violences that muſt accompany its ſucceſs; the motions of a powerful, prevailing, ſucceſſeful Faction, being ordinarily as ungovernable by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of a private perſon, as the rolling of a mighty Stone from the top of a ſteep Hill, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave rolling, till it comes to the bottom; and the longer it runs, the more violent and ungovernable is its motion.</p>
               <p>Nay, it very often comes to paſs, that a Faction in a State, if it hath any continuance, grows utterly unlike to what it firſt was; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and firſt deſignes muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change, new men and of new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſucceſſively come in play, which bring new Counſels in faſhion and requeſt: Nay, every variety of ſucceſs changes the Counſels of them that at firſt preſided in it, though they continue the ſame perſons, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93854:85"/>
put on new purpoſes, reſolutions and undertakings; ſo that if <hi>Atticus</hi> could have perſwaded himſelf to have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in any Faction, he muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have kept thoſe plauſible principles which firſt led him to that Engagement, and then he had been quite out-run by his own party, or elſe he muſt have reſolved to hold pace with his party in all their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and practices, and then he muſt out-run his Innocence, his conſtant integrity himſelf. And as thus his Prudence kept him from mingling himſelf in Faction, by a due proſpect of the ill conſequences that muſt needs ariſe to him thereby; ſo the very habit, complexion and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind admirably ſecured him againſt all temptations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>There is in moſt men a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of paſſions that renders them very obnoxious to fall in with Factions; but among them there are three ſorts of Paſſions, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed putrefactions of paſſions, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93854:85"/>
diſeaſes of the Soul, namely, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the deſire of Honour, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Place, Preferment, Covetouſneſs, or the deſire of riches, or vindictive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the deſire of revenge. And if a man do but take notice of the politick managements either of the Governors of States or Kingdoms, or of particular Affairs of leſs note, the concerns of the world are very much carried on by ſetting of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to thoſe diſtempers in men, and then they are led about and guided as men guide Puppets on a Stage, by unſeen Wires or Pulleys; ſo that thoſe motions which to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſeem free and from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet in truth, they are in kind neceſſary, and managed by others, that either wiſely or craftily propoſe but Objects to thoſe unruly paſſions; and they follow them as the Needle doth the Loadſtone. And this the crafty Heads of Factions make great uſe of; and if they find a man that is under the regiment of any of theſe Diſtempers, 'tis a thouſand to one
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93854:86"/>
but they win him over: If he find an ambitious or a mutinous or a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, he ſiddles him in the head with ſuch inſtances as theſe; wouldſt thou be great, or rich, or powerful, or revenged for ſome publick neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or affront, I will ſhew thee a ſure and compendious way of attaining thy Deſires; thou ſhalt not need to run the long, tedious, laborious race of Virtue, to attain honour, or make thee great, nor the tedious, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous application of thy ſelf to ſome Trade or calling, to make thee rich; nor the regular motion of a judicial proceſs, to avenge thy injuries: Fall in with us, and all the Honours, and power and Riches of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall at one clap fall into our diſpoſe, and thou ſhalt have the opportunity to be thine own avenger of thy affronts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. Nay further, to ſay the truth, ſuch is the Magick and Enchantment that ariſeth from thoſe intemperances of the mind, that without any ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation from without, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men headlong that way they think
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93854:86"/>
ſhorteſt to ſatisfie themſelves; and therefore are eaſily caught and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in a Faction, as that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the moſt compendious method for the attainment of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>But the Conſtitution and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the very Soul of <hi>Atticus</hi> was ſuch, that thoſe Diſtempers of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, or Revenge, dwelt not there; and by this means he was proof againſt Temptations from within or from without, to ſide with a Faction. He was honoured and eſteemed for his own Worth and Virtue, and he was not ambitious of any other acceſſions of Honour, Place, or Preferment.</p>
               <p>He had a competency of Eſtate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to ſupport himſelf and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and relieve his Friends in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and he was contented with his condition, was not deſirous of more: And as he was ſo happy, as never to have received any ſuch inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as might provoke revenge; ſo he had ſuch a calm, ſerene, even frame
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93854:87"/>
of mind, that that paſſion could get no hold upon him: And he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly well learned the beſt Leſſon of the Stoical Philoſophers, not to injure himſelf by paſſion or perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe another did him wrong; if the injuries were ſmall, he took no notice of them; if great, he ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got and forgave them. And this was all the revenge he took of injuries; and to ſay the truth, it is an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, yet innocent kind of revenge; for it makes the wrong doer quickly ſenſible of his own injuſtice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the ſame upon himſelf by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like Conſiderations were obnoxious to his Experience, as well as his Reaſon; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were acquainted, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly very familiarly, with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engaged in thoſe Factions; nay, though he might ſee eaſily an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent demonſtration of their ſucceſs, yet he would never engage in them himſelf, but avoided it as a Peſt or a Plague-ſore, wherein he was ſure, if
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93854:87"/>
he were once engaged, he ſhould loſe either his Safety, or his Innocence, or both.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Third Expedient that <hi>Atticus</hi> uſed for his Safety, refuſing too great kindneſſes from great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Third Expedient which this man uſed for his Safety, was this; That although he was alwayes ready to oblige all men by all offices of kindneſſes, yet he would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive over-great kindneſſes from great perſons, eſpecially if they were of ſuch a kind or meaſure, as he might not be able probably to requite; as great or profitable Places, Offices, Honours or Donatives: And the Reaſons that induced him to this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and declining of ſuch great
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93854:88"/>
Obligations, ſeem to be theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was a man that contented himſelf with his condition; which, as it was plentiful enough, ſo he was very well ſatisfied with what he enjoyed, and had neither an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind to become greater, or a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous mind to become richer than his Father and his Unkle left him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was a modeſt man, and did not ſet ſo high a rate upon himſelf or his Merits, as to expect a tribute of beneficence from others, as the deſert of his worth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was a grateful man; he was forgetful of injuries done to him, but mindful of Benefits received by him, and thankful for them, and eſteemed himſelf ſtill in debt, till he had made a proportionable return for kindneſſes received. And therefore if the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits were ſo great, that they were beyond requital, he thought himſelf in the condition of ſuch men as owe more than they are able to pay; which is a troubleſome and ſlaviſh condition: And ſuch his own would
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93854:88"/>
have been, if he had been ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with immenſe Courteſies.</p>
               <p>But 4. and principally, the reaſon why he declined ſuch obligations, was, becauſe he would retain his own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and continue Maſter of himſelf and his Actions; for moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immenſe benefits received from great men, render the Receiver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great ſervitude to his Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and is a great obligation for a man to think, and ſpeak, and act as their Patron deſires or expects; and certainly in a troubled State, inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Factions, ſuch kind of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are pernicious to the obliged, renders them, as it were, the Clients and Vaſſals of their Patron, and by a kind of ſecret charm or enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, makes them ſervants to him; and this obſtinacy of <hi>Atticus</hi> in theſe commotions of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a great means of his Peace, Liberty, Safety, and diſengagement from parties: And therefore when <hi>Pompey</hi> (who was a great man, popular and beneficent) endeavoured to place great Gifts and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93854:89"/>
Offices upon him, he warily and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declined them; and by that means, when <hi>Pompey</hi> ſolicited him to appear of his party againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to go with him to the wars, he was in a condition to refuſe it, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſed himſelf from that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſate ſtill at <hi>Rome,</hi> when at the ſame time thoſe perſons whom <hi>Pompey</hi> had obliged with great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and large Donatives, were fain to come to him, upon his Summons, and engage with him in that great conteſt between him and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and fall with him; for although they would have been gladly excuſed from this undertaking, yet they durſt not decline it, being under this unhappy <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that if <hi>Pompey</hi> prevailed, they ſhould have loſt his favour, and thoſe honours and offices that they enjoyed by his bounty; if <hi>Caeſar</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, yet being perſons ſo greatly obliged by <hi>Pompey,</hi> they would have been ſuſpected and oppreſſed by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or at leaſt neglected by him, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were really of the <hi>Pompey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93854:89"/>
Faction, though they declined the preſent Engagement. But howſoever their reputation would have ſuffered, and they would have been accounted a ſort of ungrateful people, that after all ſuch Obligations as they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſhould ungratefully deſert their Benefactor, when danger or difficulty appeared.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, this prudent obſtinacy of <hi>Atticus,</hi> fairly excuſed his declining of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Engagement, without the leaſt imputation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and was yet of ſingular advantage to him when <hi>Caeſar</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Victor, who highly honoured him at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the reputation of his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Diſcretion, that ſo wiſely refuſed ſuch an Engagement in <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Faction, that in the ſucceſs might otherwiſe have ruined him; and ſo wiſely refuſed all thoſe great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that <hi>Pompey</hi> would have put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that had they been received, would in all probability, have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him in his Faction. Thus our
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93854:90"/>
Author tells us, <hi>Nullum enim à Pompeio habebat ornamentum, ut c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And there was another reaſon of his modeſt refuſal of publick Honours and Offices from thoſe who had the power of conferring of them, and that had a favourable reſpect for him; for he made uſe of their Favours for a better and nobler end, namely, to reſcue and relieve men that were, or might be oppreſſed, or in extremity, in the colliſion of Factions: This uſe indeed he made of their Favours as he had opportunity. And had he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reſpects from them for his own advancement or wealth, thoſe rewards and gratuities would have precluded his opportunity of interceſſion for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He therefore prudently decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the collation of Bounties, Offices or Honours to himſelf from thoſe that had the opportunity and will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them upon him, and reſerved

                  <p>The Fourth Expedient of <hi>Atticus</hi> refuſing Offices and Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Commonwealth, by the Suffrages of the Senate or People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come to the Fourth thing which <hi>Atticus</hi> induſtriouſly avoided, namely, Publick Offices.</p>
               <p>Some Offices in <hi>Rome</hi> were in the power of particular perſons; as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, their <hi>Legati Provinciarum,</hi> Lieutenants of Provinces, which were in the gift of theſe publick Miniſters, whether Conſuls, Tribunes, or others, to whom the government of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93854:91"/>
were allotted. Theſe Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes had very honourable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table employments, commanding in affairs of Peace and War in thoſe Provinces in the abſence of the chief, and alſo of great authority while they were preſent.</p>
               <p>Other Offices were Elective or Conſtitutive by the Senate or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as Conſuls, Tribunes, Pretors, Ediles, Cenſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former Chapter I have ſhown his declining the reception of Offices from the hands of private perſons; and now I ſhall ſhew his avoiding of ſuch publick Offices as were of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick choice or donation.</p>
               <p>Offices in <hi>Rome</hi> were rarely offered, but ſought; they were beneficial and honourable employments, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Competitors; but <hi>Atticus</hi> was ſo far from ſeeking Offices, that he would not take them when offered, but induſtriouſly declined it: When the Citizens would have elected him Pretor, he refuſed it; and he made this handſome advantage thereof,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93854:91"/>
that when his Brother-in-Law <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> being afterwards elected Pretor, and had a Province aſſigned him, and offered <hi>Atticus</hi> to be his Legate, he told him that he had formerly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Office that <hi>Quintus</hi> now had, and therefore it was not decent for him to take a ſubſtitution from him.</p>
               <p>This therefore was <hi>Atticus</hi> his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he would do all the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices he could, either for particular perſons, or for the Commonwealth, in the ſtation and capacity of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon; thus he did for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Athens,</hi> while he lived there; and thus he did in <hi>Rome:</hi> But neither in the one City nor the other, could he be drawn to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any publick Office or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons whereof ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Touching publick Offices and Employments in general, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the generality of men are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken. It ſeems a wonder to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93854:92"/>
me, to ſee the folly and vanity of men, that ſo fondly hunt after great Offices and Employments: Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the State of <hi>Greece</hi> eſpecially, men better underſtood themſelves and their intereſt, and peace, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than voluntarily to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Offices and great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſomuch that there were then compulſary Laws to enforce men to undertake, not only inferiour and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Offices that were of burden and charge, but greater Offices that had honour and profit annexed to them; which though they are more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and more profitable, yet they are more dangerous and hazardous, And the truth is, that it hath been the skill and art of the wiſer ſort of mankind to annex to ſuch great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments thoſe Blandiſhments of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſteem and profit, to invite men to the undertaking of them; as Phyſicians guild their bitter Pills, that they may be the eaſier ſwallowed. The plain truth is, Offices and places of great import and truſt, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93854:92"/>
for the good of others, and for the preſervation and order of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, States and Commonwealths, and therefore the wiſdom of thoſe Kingdoms and States is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, that annex to them thoſe Enſigns of honour and honourable ſupplies for their ſupport, to invite and incourage men to undertake them; yea, and further, where thoſe invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not ſerve to draw men of worth and ability to undertake them, thoſe States are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that enact Laws to compel ſuch men to undertake them. But it is moſt certain that any man that ambitiouſly hunts after them, nay, that man that doth not induſtriouſly decline them, if poſſibly he may, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not himſelf, nor his own peace, happineſs or contentment; which will appear, if theſe things be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man that undertakes a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office or Employment, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily draw upon himſelf much envy: and the reaſon is, becauſe the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93854:93"/>
generality of Mankind have a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of themſelves, and think they deſerve thoſe Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that others enjoy, and they think alſo very well of the Offices and Employments themſelves, look upon them as goodly, fine gawdy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, and are fond of the honour and wealth that is annexed unto them, and they would fain be at them, and think thoſe that do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, ſtand in their way, and therefore they envy, and malign them, and envy is a buſie active humour, and reſtleſs, until it unhorſe thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom it faſtens, or break it ſelf in the attempt.</p>
               <p>For it is ordinarily true, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſſeth that which many deſire, hath as many Enemies and Enviers as he hath Rivals and Competitors; and as many Competitors as there are ambitious or covetous men in the world. And beſides this, all great Offices have commonly ſomewhat of power annexed to them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Societies of men can never
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93854:93"/>
ſubſiſt in order without ſome power be over them, yet particular perſons commonly hate and envy any power in any but themſelves.</p>
               <p>2. A man that undertakes a publick employment, is under a powerful temptation to loſe and give up all that quiet, and reſt, and tranquillity that a private Station yields; and if not all, yet a great part of his liberty, and diveſts himſelf of himſelf; and do what he can, he muſt in a great meaſure give himſelf up to others, as the price of that honour, pre-he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and power which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys; which is too dear a purchaſe for any wiſe and conſiderate man that can well avoid it.</p>
               <p>3. There is no man ſo wiſe, ſo dexterous in buſineſs of publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, ſo attentive to it, nor ſo fortunate in it, but hath his defects, incogitancies and inadvertencies, or at leaſt misfortunes in it; and theſe deficiencies in a private ſtation, are leſs perceived and obſerved, and the conſequences of them are narrow,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93854:94"/>
and moſt commonly within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of a mans ſelf or his Family: But in a man of a publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firſt, theſe defects are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerved, and ſeen; as his perſon and ſtation is conſpicuous, ſo his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are eaſily ſeen by any By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>2. As they are eaſily ſeen, ſo they are diligently watched and obſerved; he wants not ſuch Spectators as make it their buſineſs to be diligent ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and obſervers of them.</p>
               <p>3. When thoſe defects at any time appear, though perchance they are but few and ſmall, yet they are the objects of moſt ſevere cenſure and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion.</p>
               <p>If a private mans wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or prudence, do <hi>ad plurimum</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance his follies or inadvertencies, the man paſſeth for a wiſe and good man; but a little folly in a man in a great employment, ſhall cloud and overſhadow in the publick eſteem all his wiſdom and goodneſs, though this be far the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:93854:94"/>
4. But that which is worſt of all, the errors, miſtakes, miſcarriages or inadvertencies of a private man hurts none but himſelf or his narrow Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But even ſmall errors or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, or follies in a man of publick employment, and in the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be of a vaſt and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive concern, and the ill conſequences thereof oftentimes irreparable. An Errour of a Judge in his Judgment, may miſlead or undo thouſands; an Errour in Counſel in a Counſellor, may ruine a State or Kingdom, an Errour in Conduct in a General, may deſtroy an Army: And ſurely eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe man will as much as he may, keep himſelf out of theſe hazardous conſequences, ſince every wiſe man knows that his is not without his mixtures of folly and weakneſs.</p>
               <p>4. Again, let a man in publick employment, manage them with all the integrity and wiſdom imaginable, yet the Race is not alwayes to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong; there may be, there will be often times ſuch
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93854:95"/>
diſappointments and croſs events, that will bring ill ſucceſs to the beſt and wiſeſt endeavours, and then not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his wiſdom and fidelity, the ill ſucceſs ſhall be attributed to his want of integrity, courage or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Every fool will be ready to ſay, if the Counſel had been thus, the event had been otherwiſe; and the people ſhall either perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or be perſwaded by others, that the man was either falſe or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in his employment; yea, and the State wherein he lived, either to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the people, or to hold up their credit, and an expectation of better ſucceſs when others are employed, will be ready to make a politick Sacrifice of ſuch a Miniſter of State, whoſe fault was not to be falſe, or a fool, but only to be unfortunate.</p>
               <p>5. Again, There is no politick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the world, but muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a conſiderable party of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind his Enemy: If he be one judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, he muſt pronounce to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of one party, and then that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93854:95"/>
party that hates him, if he be an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer employed in the iſſuing of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenue, he that ſtays longeſt for his Money, hates him; if he be employed in diſpenſation of rewards; offices or places, as Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, he that is diſappointed in his expectation, or that finds leſs than he expected, hates him: And it will not be material to the ſafety of him, that is hated, whether there be cauſe or not, if the party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked think he hath cauſe, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation is as high as if it were juſt; and moſt commonly is provided with a calumny to infuſe into the people to make them believe it ſo. And if it be ſaid in all theſe and the like caſes, the party makes as many Friends as he doth Enemies; for if one be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, another is rewarded; and if one be pronounced againſt, another is pronounced for: This mends not the matter; for ſuppoſed injuries are longer remembred than real benefits; and commonly he that receives a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, eſteems it his due; he that goes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93854:96"/>
without it, thinks it an injury: And hatred and revenge are more active and vigilant to do miſchief upon a ſuppoſed injury or neglect, than duty or gratitude is to defend one, from whom either Juſtice or Benefit hath been received.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe, and many more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reaſons, it is beyond queſtion, that no conſiderate man hath reaſon to be fond of any publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though attended with honour, power and profit; but fairly to decline it if he may: And therefore it is no wonder that <hi>Pomponi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Atticus,</hi> who was a wiſe, knowing man, was ſo far from ſeeking it, that he declined it when offered.</p>
               <p>2. But ſuppoſing that in a calm, ſedate time, this wiſe and good man might have been perſwaded to take an honourable publick employment, and that it had not been only conſiſtent with his Wiſdom, but his Duty ſo to have done; and that if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it, it had been either an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of puſillanimity or fooliſhneſs,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93854:96"/>
yea, and injuſtice to partake of the benefit and protection of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſters and Officers of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have denied the ſame common Offices to others, when by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages or nomination of thoſe who were intruſted therein, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a publick Miniſter; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſidering the time wherein he lived, and the great Diſtempers that prevailed in that State, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of publick employments, was not only excuſable and juſtifiable, but alſo very commendable, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence full of prudence and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: For he that takes a publick employment in a troubled State, is (without the intervention of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous providence) firſt, and before any others, expoſed to the ſhock of all publick commotions: If a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevail, if he either oppoſe it, or be ſuſpected by it, he is ſure to be one of the firſt that muſt be ruined by it, becauſe he will be thought an impediment to the Deſign; and it is a wonder if he eſcape without an
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93854:97"/>
Exile or Confiſcation. On the other ſide, if he be in the good opinion of that Faction, and ſo continued in his employment, he is under an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only in the hazard of their Fortune, but alſo in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and execution of all thoſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enterprizes that ſuch a Faction thinks neceſſary or convenient for their eſtabliſhment; which if he do not, then unleſs they otherwiſe fear him, or exceedingly reverence his perſon, as one that may credit their Party, he is ſure to be dealt more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with, than if he had at firſt oppoſed them. On the other ſide, if he comply with them, and ſerve their turns, and proſecute their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the publick ſtation wherein he ſtands, he ſhall loſe his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his innocence, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in a moſt baſe ſervitude, and be made inſtrumental in thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which perchance he inwardly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors; and if he ſtart or boggle at them, he ſhall be dealt with as the worſt of Enemies: And if ever
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93854:97"/>
there come a turn of Affairs, he ſhall be ſure to be one of the firſt that is cruſhed by the prevailing party: And this <hi>Cicero</hi> found to be true, to his coſt; for he, that while he was but an Advocate, ſtood unſhaken in all thoſe troubleſome times wherein he lived (though he ſometimes uſed his Tongue with too much liberty in his publick Orations) yet when once he became entangled in publick Offices of <hi>Conſul</hi> and <hi>Senator,</hi> he quickly felt the power and vindictivenes of the party of <hi>Anthony,</hi> upon his return; and loſt his Life in the Fury and Rage of his incenſed Adverſary, which he had eſcaped, had he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wiſe example of his Friend <hi>Atticus,</hi> in declining publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore <hi>Cato Uticenſis,</hi> who the greateſt part of his Life had been concerned in publick Offices and Employments in <hi>Rome,</hi> yet when he found himſelf over-born by the <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Party, learned, though too late, <hi>Atticus</hi> his wiſdom, and left this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to his Son, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93854:98"/>
engage himſelf in the publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, offices or employment of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>And truly <hi>Atticus</hi> by this wiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from publick Offices and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, obtained much of that Safety and Happineſs which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this means he enjoyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his tranquillity of Mind and Life, and all thoſe advantages and opportunities of improving his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Knowledge, which he could never have had in a publick ſtation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this means he kept himſelf free from Enemies or Emulation, Envy and Detraction, the common Attendants of publick and great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this means he kept both his Safety, his Innocence and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all of which muſt neceſſarily be greatly endangered, if not utterly loſt, had he taken upon himſelf any publick Office in thoſe turbulent times.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:93854:98"/>
4. By this means he preſerved his Power, Intereſt and Veneration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Parties, and was able to do better Offices with the prevailing party, for the Safeguard and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good men, than if he had born the greateſt Offices, and with the beſt applauſe in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the Hiſtory of his Life.</p>

                  <p>The Fifth Expedient that <hi>Atticus</hi> uſed to preſerve himſelf, was, the avoiding of all thoſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might procure unto him Emulation or Envy.</p>

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:93854:100"/>
This appears already in part, by his declining of Offices, of Honour, of Power and Profit; but I ſhall give this as a diſtinct Conſideration, becauſe I ſhall evidence it with far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances.</p>
               <p>When he was at <hi>Athens,</hi> he was ſolicited to accept of honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; but although as a private man, he did them all the friendly Offices he could, yet he refuſed their publick Honours; they then deſired that he would be enrolled as a free Citizen of <hi>Athens;</hi> but this he alſo refuſed, as knowing it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be a deſerting of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Enemies, or at leaſt Envy: They alſo ſolicited him, that his Statue might be ſet up at <hi>Athens,</hi> among their Worthies and Benefactors; but this alſo he would by no means allow of, for the ſame reaſon; although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his receſs from that City, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, notwithſtanding his refuſal, did in his abſence ſet up his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93854:100"/>
And this refuſing of this Piece of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry, namely, the publick ſetting up of his Statue or Picture, though it ſeems a ſmall matter, was ſurely an act of great prudence, for he that allows the ſetting up of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Picture, firſt, draws upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much envy: other perſons that have not the ſame honour done them, malign him that hath it, as having that piece of publick favour done him, which another thinks he as well at leaſt deſerves.</p>
               <p>2. It gives unſeen detractions or cenſure, expoſing to every mans eye that Object that adminiſters occaſion of cenſure; <hi>This is that mans Statue, that did ſuch an injury, that committed ſuch an Error or Overſight:</hi> ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Monument of ſo much more diſadvantage to the Prototype, by how much men are more apt to take notice of, and remember the evils, than the good of any perſon. 3. If that State or City take up any diſtaſte againſt the Perſon, the poor Statue commonly receives the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93854:101"/>
and the man is proſecuted <hi>in effigie;</hi> he hath committed a <hi>Depoſitum</hi> unto that State or City, that muſt engage him to their perpetual ſervice and pleaſing of them, or in default thereof, to be the Subject of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely or publick indignity <hi>in effigie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he came back to <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his refuſal of publick and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Offices, he kept himſelf in the ſtate of a private Gentleman; and notwithſtanding the acceſs of a fair Eſtate from his Unkle <hi>Caecilius,</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceeded his former charge or method of Houſe-keeping; indeed he thereupon enlarged his private libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and beneficence to perſons that ſtood in need thereof; but he did not at all thereupon advance the Port or Equipage of his Houſe-keeping or manner of living; his Houſe was plain, though noble; and he never would by new Building, make it ſtately or ſplendid, but contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with it as he found it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were rich, yet to avoid the glory of being ſaid to be a great
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93854:101"/>
Purchaſer, he never would make any new Purchaſes, but kept the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Unkle, well knowing that great Purchaſes would make a great noiſe and rumor, occaſion envy, and become but a troubleſome burden and incumbrance, rather than a benefit or advantage in a troubled State.</p>
               <p>His Money would be a portable commodity for his ſubſiſtence, and ready to ſupply the neceſſities and emergencies of himſelf and his Friends, when his Lands muſt be neceſſarily fixed, and in troubled times might yield him little revenue, and were of neceſſity to abide the Storms of that place wherein they lay. In ſhort, he kept ſuch a mediocrity in his Houſe, his Furniture, his Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expences, his Entertainments, and the manner of his Living, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſed him to ſcorn on the one hand, nor conſure, or envy, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of affecting either too much Grandour and Popularity, on the other, nor conſumed or waſted his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93854:102"/>
Eſtate, but left himſelf in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual capacity of ſupplying the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Friends, which he juſtly eſteemed the beſt Employment of his Wealth; and yet he ſo ordered his Affairs and Expences, with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and prudence, that kept him above the imputation of baſeneſs or unworthy parſimony. And by this means he avoided envy on the one hand, and contempt on the other; keeping himſelf in a middle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant conduct between all extreams. It is true, in the latter end of his Life, he was, by the importunity of <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Octavius,</hi> drawn to match his Niece into the Family and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Octavius,</hi> which ſeemed to be a ſtep beyond his degree, and that mediocrity that he uſed and affected in the former courſe of his Life: But it was not a thing ſought by him, but from him, the great <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> being ambitious of his Affinity, whom they very well knew to be a man of as great intereſt and eſteem, and power in the City of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93854:102"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> as any private perſon could poſſibly be; and that intereſt, eſteem and power bottomed upon as firm a <hi>Baſis</hi> as could poſſibly be expected; namely, the native and experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prudence and worth of the man: And therefore they thought that whatever mutability of Fortune their high flying attempts might meet with, yet they had, by this affinity with <hi>Atticus,</hi> a more firm intereſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> than if they had matched their. Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Family of a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Army of forty thouſand men. Beſides all this, he was rich, and might probably leave a fair For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which he accordingly did. And laſtly, the times now ſeemed pretty well ſetled, the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Antonius, Octavius</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> had maſtered all oppoſition, and although there afterwards broke out Wars between <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> yet that was not long before <hi>Atticus</hi> his Death; and as he was not likely to live to ſee thoſe eruptions; ſo if he ſhould, he could not probably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93854:103"/>
their iſſue; neither did he: for he died the year before the Battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> wherein <hi>Anthony</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by <hi>Octavius:</hi> And yet if theſe differences had been in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he was reaſonable ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whatſoever iſſue ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in it, both the Heads of that Faction being his Admirers and Friends, and his great Age giving him the Protection and Priviledge of ſitting ſtill between them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Sixth Expedient, the avoiding of all occaſions of Enmity from any.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Sixth thing that this wiſe man induſtriouſly avoided in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Safety, was, all manner of envy from any, and all occaſions and opportunities thereof, that humane Prudence could poſſibly foreſee.</p>
               <p>This hath been in part ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the precedent Chapters, in his declining of Factions, Offices, and Excitations of Envy; but it ſhall be here proſecuted with farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that more directly and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically were ordered againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more eſpecially relate to the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93854:104"/>
avoiding of publick Differences, and the Enmities ariſing by it; but theſe relate to ſuch Enmities as concern a man in a private ſtation.</p>
               <p>There be theſe enſuing occaſions, that commonly create Animoſities and Enmities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is an accuſer or Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againſt any man for matters of Crime or Miſdemeanor, makes the party accuſed, and all his Relations his Enemies; nay, though he do it but as an Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the ſharpneſs of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Tongue in his Declarations, though it procured him ſome Friends, it created him many more Enemies, that did ſit cloſe upon him when they had opportunity; though the occaſion of his ruine, was his publick Action: But <hi>Atticus</hi> was ever careful to avoid this.</p>
               <p>He never would be an accuſer of any, either as Party or Advocate, nor ſubſcribe any publick Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing that creates Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93854:104"/>
is Litigiouſneſs, Contention, and going to Law for every Trifle: This excellent man did with that prudence order his Affairs, that the Author of his Life tells us he never had any Law-Suit. His Wiſdom was ſuch, that it prevented him from great or waſting injuries: And his Goodneſs was ſuch, that he rather forgave Injuries of a leſs magnitude, than proſecuted the wrong-doers: It was one of the great commendations of his Life, that he quickly forgot the Injuries that he received, and the kindneſs that he received, and the kindneſs that he had done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third thing that creates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, is when a man is Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Collector of thoſe troubleſome Duties, where many are concerned, a Publican or Farmer of Cuſtoms or Tolls: For ſuch men are commonly hated by the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now <hi>Atticus,</hi> although ſome Conjectures there are, that he was ſometime Farmer of the <hi>Vectigalia,</hi> yet the Writer of his Life aſſures us the contrary; or certainly if he were
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93854:105"/>
ſo at any time, he quickly left that Employment, as a probable root of Contentions and Enmity and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth thing that creatos E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is when a man deals much in the Goods or Lands that are Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by the power of any Faction: Such Confiſcations were frequent in <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the viciſſitudes of the prevalence of Factions were frequent; and hither perſons often came, and met with good Bargains; But <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> wholly declined thoſe publick Markets, not only becauſe it would be a mark of a covetous mind, but becauſe he knew that the former Owners would bear a ſecret indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and enmity againſt the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers and Poſſeſſors of their Goods; and ſuch Purchaſes carried with them a clear evidence that the Purchaſers approved the party and violences of thoſe men that thus confiſcated and expoſed ſuch Goods to Sale; and it was againſt the Principles of <hi>Atticus,</hi> to give ſo much countenance or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93854:105"/>
to the proceedings of any of thoſe Factions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Fifth thing that often creates men trouble, eſpecially in a troubled State, is the too much prodigality of Speech. An over-free, inconſiderate commendation of ſome perſons of one party, or too liberal Invectives or Cenſures of the Perſons engaged in another, create oftentimes Enemies, and give a man a Blow when he hath forgot it, or thinks not of it; ſome Enemy of a perſon commended, or Friend of the perſon cenſured, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes reporting to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the firſt Speaker: In this kind <hi>Atticus</hi> was very wary; he was not liberal of his Tongue either in praiſes or diſpraiſes of this or that party, or the perſons concerned in it: And if any time he commended any perſon, it was upon the account of his due perſonal worth and virtue, without contemplation or reſpect of parties, or the concerns thereof:</p>
               <p>Pride and Haughtineſs of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth infallibly create more ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93854:106"/>
than any one Diſtemper beſides, and indeed is commonly the root of all Contentions and Animoſities both in publick and in private perſons. A proud man in effect reſiſteth all men, and therefore doth either neceſſitate, or at leaſt engage all men to oppoſe him, and become his enemy: But herein was <hi>Atticus</hi> his great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that in his whole courſe of Life, he always kept an humble mind, and an humble deportment: When he lived at <hi>Athens,</hi> our Author tells us, <hi>Sic ſe gerebat ut communis infimis par Principibus videretur; ex quo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt ut huic omnes honores quos poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent publicè haberent:</hi> The like was his deportment at <hi>Rome,</hi> And certainly this Humility of mind, and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and freeneſs from all manner of pride, brought him very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for it kept him in a true eſtimate and judgment of things. Pride and Vain-glory blinds the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Humility, and Lowlineſs, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders every thing in its true and juſt eſtimate and value.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:93854:106"/>
2. It kept him in great tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind, as well as of Life; it is not poſſible for any man to ſuffer ſo much torture and vexation from all the affronts and injuries without, as from a proud heart that galleth and vexeth it ſelf, when it cannot have its will; but an humble man in all ſtates and conditions ſtands ſquare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Baſis, without any great diſorder or perturbation.</p>
               <p>3. By this means he greatly ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his own ſafety in publick dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; for by reaſon of his humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, he got but few enemies; and if there were any, ſuch this humble carriage either melted them into Friends, or gave that relaxation and abatement to their fervor and animoſity, that they never attempted to hurt him, though poſſibly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of a Faction wherein they were parties, gave them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>And yet though his deportment were full of humility and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it was not without a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93854:107"/>
Gravity and Grandeur, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, though he was affable and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet he rendred not himſelf cheap and contemptible; ſo that as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us, it was a hard thing to tell, whether the very ſame men did more love or fear him.</p>
               <p>And certainly this part of <hi>Atticus</hi> his management was a ſingular means of his ſafety, and an excellent indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his prudence, eſpecially in troubleſome and difficult times; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a wiſe and circumſpect avoiding of making Enemies: It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon folly of men great in place, power or wealth, to think themſelves above the reach of enemies, of the meaner ſort eſpecially; and therefore they care not how many they diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige by their inſolence, ſcorns, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or neglects: This is a piece of great weakneſs and folly; for it is a certain truth, that there is no man, though never ſo mean, but once in ſeven years will have an opportunity to do the greateſt man much good or much harm. When the Mouſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93854:107"/>
troubled the ſleeping Lion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed him, and happened to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Paw, he deſired the Lion to ſpare him, he was but a Mouſe, and yet might live poſſibly to do him a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but howſoever was not worth his indignation: the Mouſe afterwards ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to eat aſunder that Net that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled the Lion, and ſo deliver him, that for all his Greatneſs, could not deliver himſelf: Kindneſs, and Affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Gentleneſs are but cheap and eaſie things, and as eaſily exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as Roughneſs and Acerbity; and when a man can make a friend upon as eaſie terms as he can make an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he is imprudent if he do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for a mean Friend may be able ſometimes to do a great kindneſs to a great man, and a little enemy may have an opportunity to do a great Miſchief.</p>
               <p>In tumultuous times an ordinary common Souldier is Maſter of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Life and Eſtate, either in the unbridled rage of a Storm, or by a falſe accuſation: He therefore that means to ſit ſafe in ſtormy times, muſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93854:108"/>
be careful with <hi>Atticus,</hi> to avoid the making of Enemies, even in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtation, as well as in his publick, and muſt never think any perſon ſo deſpicable, but that he may ſome way or other, or at ſome time or other, do him a miſchief; and therefore muſt never unneceſſarily provoke any, or make him an Enemy, if he can fairly avoid it.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the principal things obſervable in the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> which he principally avoided in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Safety and Tranquillity in troubleſome times.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The conſideration of the things that <hi>Atticus</hi> did in order to his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Security againſt the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Troubles of the Times; and firſt, touching his Charity, Bounty and Liberality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have done with thoſe things which this wiſe man avoided in order to his Safety in troublous times. I come now to the things he did; which as they were worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in themſelves, ſo they were the great Means of his Safety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>In the precedent Chapter, I ſhewed his Prudence and Induſtry to avoid making himſelf Enemies; this was that he conſciouſly avoided: But he did not only avoid the procuring of Enemies, but was prudent and wiſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93854:109"/>
in making very many Friends: This conduced greatly to his Safety and Preſervation.</p>
               <p>And the means whereby he thus made ſo many his Friends, was his Liberality, Beneficence and Bounty, eſpecially to thoſe in diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>But although the ſafety that he had, was partly the conſequence of his many Friends that he procured, and the berieficence that he uſed, was one great means of procuring Friends; yet herein conſiſted the excellence of the Man, that he was not bountiful and beneficent upon the bare account of procuring Friends, or by them to ſecure his ſafety: But the principle of his beneſicence was higher and nobler than his own intereſt and ſafety; for it aroſe from the nobleneſs of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, and was a certain native generoſity and beneficence to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that prevailed upon him to be greateful to thoſe that did him kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. bountiful to thoſe he loved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to thoſe in miſery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent to Mankind in general: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93854:109"/>
the Conſequence and effect of this goodneſs was the multiplication of Friends, and his ſecurity in times of danger. But that was not the great Wheel that moved him to it, but the admirable conſtitution and habit of his Mind, which would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſuch, though there had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been Friends nor ſafety acquired by it: For he had a ſelf-contentation in the egreſſes of his own bounty and goodneſs, though it had never reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own Honour, Safety or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>And this is the more evident, for that the Inſtances of his Liberality and Beneficence were moſt frequent and eminent towards ſuch as were in greateſt diſtreſs, and below the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ever making a retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereby, as our Author tells us, it was evident that neither Hopes nor Fears, nor Self-ends or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, were the motives of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, but the Virtue, Goodneſs, and Beneficence of his Naure and Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:93854:110"/>
But becauſe if his Beneficence had been ſingly to any one ſingle party or Faction, or only to that Faction that were undermoſt, it might have been interpreted a ſecret compliance with them, and adherence to them, and ſo rendred him ſuſpected to thoſe that attained the upper hand, he ſo wiſely ordered his Charity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence to the oppreſſed, that at the ſame time he alſo liberally preſented the Victors; and thoſe things he did not poorly and ſneakingly, but bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly, that the oppreſſed might ſee he countenanced not their Cauſe, but regarded their wants; and the Victors might ſee he durſt do good to the neceſſitous, though their Enemies; and all the World might ſee that his Charity and Goodneſs was directed to the Humane Nature, not to encourage or flatter Factions: Some Inſtances hereof are given in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his Life.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Marius</hi> was declared an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the State, he aſſiſted him with Neceſſaries in his flight; and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93854:110"/>
when <hi>Sylla,</hi> a declared Enemy by <hi>Marius,</hi> viſited <hi>Atticus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> he entertained him with honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> was hardly beſet by the power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he ſupplied him and his Aſſiſtants with Money for their ſupport; and yet at the ſame time ſupplied <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Followers with Money for their wants.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Aſſiſtants were oppreſſed by the power of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> he ſupplied them with Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: And when afterwards it was <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fate to be declared a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy, and his condition ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſperate, in ſomuch that the very Friends of <hi>Anthony</hi> turned bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Family, he then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Patronage and protection of the Family of <hi>Anthony,</hi> relieved and ſupported <hi>Fulvia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Volummius,</hi> one of his Family, and ſtood between them and the violence uſed againſt them, and ſupplied them with Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93854:111"/>
And in this Liberality and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of <hi>Atticus,</hi> theſe things are very obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was full of ſincerity and integrity; his greateſt Bounty and Erogations commonly employed upon thoſe that were not in any likelihood of making him any return; ſuch were his diſtribution of Corn among the poor at <hi>Athens,</hi> his relief of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Pompey, Brutus,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Anthony,</hi> when they were at the loweſt, and their Caſes ſeemingly deſperate; <hi>Nec Deſperatos reliquit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was full of equality and impartial: If <hi>Brutus</hi> were in diſtreſs, he relieved him; if <hi>Anthony,</hi> though of a contrary Faction, were in diſtreſs, he relieved him: His Liberality was not <hi>intuitu partis,</hi> or governed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any particular Faction; but <hi>intuitu humani generis,</hi> a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity to humane Nature, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the party was, yet if he were in diſtreſs, he had the experience of his Bounty. And upon the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, neither party took amiſs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93854:111"/>
what he did for the other, becauſe they found he did the like for them, when their turn was to be lowermoſt. And indeed the viciſſitudes of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Factions of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> had made all parties wiſe, ſo that they became pretty well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to find ſuch a common Promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary and Treaſury of Beneficence, which though their ſuppreſſed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary now taſted, might be of equal advantage to them at the next turn of Fortune.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was full of ſingular pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <hi>Pompey</hi> and his party were in ſome diſtreſs, he relieved them; <hi>Caeſar</hi> wanted not his Relief; yet <hi>Atticus</hi> preſents him liberally; this was not to bribe each party; but it was to give aſſiſtance to their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: <hi>Caeſar</hi> no leſs honoured him then <hi>Pompey.</hi> And by theſe prudent contemporations he made his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality ſafe, and gave aſſurance to all parties, that the Bounty to either party, was not a compliance with parties, but an excellent beneficence to Mankind in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:93854:112"/>
And therefore when either party ſolicited him to any thing that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of the countenance of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he conſtantly declined it; as when <hi>Sylla</hi> perſwaded him to go with him to <hi>Italy,</hi> and the party of <hi>Brutus</hi> ſolicited him to contribute to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Treaſury for <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> endeavoured to draw him to his Army. By all which, all parties and all men were fully ſatisfied that the Bounty of <hi>Atticus</hi> was not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Factions, or for private deſigns or ends, but the emanation of a noble and benign Soul, full of rivers of Goodneſs, Clemency and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</p>
               <p>And now we will a little conſider the ſingular effects that this Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Liberality and Charity had in all the Succeſſes of his Life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this means he removed our of the Minds of all men all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy which commonly waits upon Wealthy men; for he was ſo true a Steward, and generous Diſpenſer of the Wealth he had, that no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93854:112"/>
his Riches, but wiſhed it more: For they well knew that when their misfortunes or neceſſities made them ſtand in need of relief, he was ready to diſpoſe of it for their ſupply.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is nothing in the world renders a man more popular and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all; and ſo it made him.</p>
               <p>And although Popularity is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing in a State, when it meets in an ambitious Spirit, yet it is ſafe and deſirable when found in a good, and peaceable, and wiſe man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Liberality or Bounty was ſo diffuſive, that it exceedingly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied his Friends: Every man that had taſted of his Bounty, became his Friend and Advocate; in ſomuch that there was no one party or Faction in <hi>Rome,</hi> but had a conſiderable perſon of it obliged unto <hi>Atticus,</hi> by his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, whereby it came to paſs that in all the Revolutions and Viciſſitudes of ſucceſſes of conteſting Factions, he never wanted ſome conſiderable perſons in power, that were ſtudious of ſerving him and his Friends, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93854:113"/>
were his Advocates, if he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſequently this Bounty and Liberality of <hi>Atticus</hi> was one of the great Inſtruments of Safety in all thoſe various Revolutions that happened in <hi>Rome</hi> during his Life. This was one thing that rendred <hi>Atticus</hi> ſo ſafe, and ſo acceptable to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Victor over <hi>Pompey:</hi> The kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and liberality which he ſhewed to the Family and Relations of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> in his diſtreſs, was that which rendred him ſo acceptable to <hi>Anthony,</hi> at his return Victor over <hi>Brutus;</hi> that while thouſands were baniſhed or deſtroyed, and <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf ſlain in the rage of that Revolution, <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was protected and highly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; inſomuch that he obtained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection hot only for himſelf, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Friends that were in the Black Liſt of Death, Confiſeation; or Baniſhment, as appears at large in the Hiſtory of his Life.</p>
               <p>It is true that this Expedient of Safety is not exerciſeable by men of

                  <p>The Second thing which <hi>Atticus</hi> did in order whereby he ſecured himſelf.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Second Obſervable in the practice of <hi>Atticus,</hi> was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to his Friends under all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; whereby he never ceaſed to do them all Offices of Kindneſs and Beneficence, were their Fortunes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo low and deſperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius,</hi> though a turbulent perſon, yet was perſonally the Friend of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> and his Son bred up at School with him; when the Father fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſupplied him with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> was a Friend of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and in his diſtreſs <hi>Atticus</hi> ſupplied him liberally in his neceſſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> was a familiar Acquaintance
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93854:117"/>
of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and when he was forced to deſert <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſupplied him in his ſtreights and neceſſities with Money, and after the Battel at <hi>Philippi,</hi> where <hi>Brutus</hi> was ſlain, maintained <hi>Servilia</hi> his Mother, and uſed his Intereſt with <hi>Anthony,</hi> and procured the liberty of many of his Friends that were taken after that Battel, as <hi>Gellius, Canius, Julius Canidius,</hi> and others; the like he did after the Battel of <hi>Philippi,</hi> for <hi>Julius Morilla</hi> the Pretor, <hi>Aulus Torquatus,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Quintius</hi> his Brother-in-Law, and others of his Friends that were engaged in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and misfortune of <hi>Pompey:</hi> Thus he always improved his intereſt that he had in <hi>Julius Caeſar, Anthony,</hi> and other the Heads of great Factions in <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Victory fell on their ſide, not to make himſelf rich or great, but to deliver his friends from the common calamities that befel them in the fall of that Party wherein they were unhappily engaged: Only the Ruine of <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſo ſudden, that it prevented the interceſſion of <hi>Atticus</hi> in his behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:93854:117"/>
Neither can I omit that admirable piece of fidelity to his Friends, and yet that admirable Prudence, that though it fell out oftentimes that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Friends were engaged in oppoſite Factions, and extream ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities and irreconcileable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, yet ſo he ordered the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he kept an intimate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them all, correſponded with them all, and had the entire Love and Service of them all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breach of Friendſhip, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the diſpleaſure or jealouſie of any of them or of their Relations: <hi>Marius</hi> was his Friend, and ſo was <hi>Sylla,</hi> and yet engaged in irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable enmity between themſelves. <hi>Pompey</hi> was his Friend, and ſo was <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> yet engaged in deſperate Wars each againſt the other. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was his Friend, and ſo was <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> yet mortal Enemies one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Anthony</hi> was his Friend, and ſo was <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> and yet both implacable enemies each to other.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93854:118"/>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the two greateſt Maſters of Eloquence of <hi>Rome,</hi> had great emulations between them, and yet notwithſtanding all thoſe bitter and irreconcileable Feuds and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations between theſe Friends of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> though he were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile their differences, he ſtill kept up an entire Friendſhip with them all, correſpondent with them by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Entertainments, and all Offices of Friendſhip with them all, was bountiful to them all, relieved them all in the viciſſitudes of their Exigences and Misfortunes, and kept himſelf yet free from engaging in their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, nor rendred himſelf ſuſpected to either party. They all knew his integrity and his wiſdom, and were abundantly ſatisfied that his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Beneficence to either party, were acts of pure and generous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not leavened, or tainted, or ſtained with baſe Ends, or Hopes, or Deſigns. And this Fidelity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to his Friends, cauſed all men to love and honour him, and to deſire
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93854:118"/>
his Friendſhip, and engaged his Friends in great firmneſs and fidelity to him. And this among all the reſt of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and prudent managements, was a great ſecurity to him: For, as before I obſerved, his Friends were hereby ſo multiplied and encreaſed, that there was not, nor indeed could be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Rome,</hi> but had a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Friends of <hi>Atticus,</hi> whom he had formerly engaged by great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits mingled with it, which were as ſo many Protectors, or at leaſt Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Inſtruments of his Safety and Preſervation upon any Revolutions that happened or could happen in the City or State of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Third Expedient conducing to the Safety of <hi>Atticus;</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable moderation and equality of Mind and Actions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONe of the greateſt Enemies to any mans Peace and Safety, is the immoderation and exceſs of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ordinarily carries men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exceſſes and extreams, and creates to a man Enemies and troubles if it find none; tranſports men beyond the bounds of Wiſdom or Reaſon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it breaks out into rude, harſh and offenſive actions, ſometimes into provoking and irritating Speeches, and alwayes diſorders the judgment, and brings precipitation and inadvertence into the actions: But our worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93854:119"/>
was quite of another Make; he governed his paſſions, and thereby go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his Actions and Speeches, was deliberate, and conſiderate, and of great moderation: He was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tranſported to love and admire every man that either did him a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or was great in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; he underſtood and weighed wherein their ends and deſigns lay: neither was he preſently tranſported with hatred and indignation of every perſon that was voted an Enemy by the Senate; he allowed ſomething in thoſe Sentences to the Paſſions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Ends of Perſons, Parties and Factions: Though he was an Enemy to Faction in the State, yet he did not preſently conclude that all the men that were engaged in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were Enemies to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; he conſidered that ſome might mean well, and were ignorant of the Deſigns and Ends of thoſe that commonly governed the Party; who like a prevailing Humor or Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, many times carried weak or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93854:120"/>
men beyond their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore he was not of that common humor of the Vulgar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is ſaid,
<q>
                     <p>Sequitur Fortunam ſemper; &amp; odit Damnatos.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore as on the one ſide he was not cheated into parties by the goodly pretences of them that raiſed or managed them; ſo he was not tranſported with hatred &amp; deteſtation of all that were of them: As he had his Allay that made him not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of the former, ſo he had an allowance of Charity and Gentleneſs for the latter; whereby he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his Cenſures of them, and his diſlike of them and their proceedings, left ſtill a room for their relief in their neceſſities, and for an interceſſion for mercy for them, with thoſe in power.</p>
               <p>He looked upon the commotions in the State of both ſides to be but the product of Faction, a Diſeaſe and Diſtemper, not the true Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93854:120"/>
and Complexion of the State, and therefore in the colliſion of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he did not preſently judge that the beſt that prevailed, nor that the worſt that was ſuppreſſed, they had each their errors, and faults, and miſchiefs to the Commonwealth, which poſſibly were in themſelves equal, notwithſtanding the diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſucceſs: And therefore he did not preſently fall in with the prevailing party, and adore it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoſe meaſures of Charity to the adverſe party, which he uſed to deal to them in diſtreſs; poſſibly he thought them not leſs innocent than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though leſs fortunate, and therefore eſteemed them much at one in their merit or rather demerit; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſtreſſed ſtood more in need of his Charity than the Victors, and therefore they had more of it.</p>
               <p>Again, when he ſaw the Rage and Fury, and Proſcriptions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations that the conquering party uſed againſt thoſe that had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the other ſide, though he
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93854:121"/>
hated and deteſted that Cruelty and Fierceneſs that he ſaw exerciſed by Citizens of the ſame Commonwealth and City, againſt their Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as breaches not only of the Bonds of Civil Society, but as Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon Humanity it ſelf; yet he ſtill governed himſelf with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as not to fall foul upon the Victors with publick Invectives and Phillippiques: For he well knew that would but irritate and provoke their Rage, and poſſibly diſable him to do thoſe Offices of kindneſs for his Friends that fell under the power of the Victors: And beſides, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Viciſſitudes of Succeſſes in adverſe Factions, had well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that it was the common Method of which ſoever Faction prevailed, to uſe all Extremities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other: And although this cruel Cuſtom did no way juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the things they did, nor rendred them excuſable in the judgment of <hi>Atticus;</hi> yet it gave a little allay to the cenſure of their ſeverity, that had
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93854:121"/>
the other Faction prevailed, they would have done no leſs by them.</p>
               <p>And this moderation of <hi>Atticus</hi> gave him great ſecurity in troubleſom times, procured him Friends, kept him conſiderate and circumſpect in all he did, that he never overſhot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Folly, Paſſion or precipitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in words or action.</p>

                  <p>Cancerning the Fourth Expedient conducing to the Safety of <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> his Constancy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF I ſhould follow <hi>Atticus</hi> through all thoſe expreſſions of his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wiſdom, joined with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vertue and Goodneſs, my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations would be too voluminous: The truth is, there is ſcarce any one part or paſſage of his Life, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves remark. My Author truly ſayes, <hi>Difficile eſt omnia dicere, &amp; non neceſſaria:</hi> I ſhall therefore conclude all with this one Obſervation more; namely, his <hi>Conſtancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He was conſtant to his Friends, even in their loweſt and moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition; he ever retained his Love to them, and it was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Love, but ſuch as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93854:122"/>
it ſelf in real indications, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in their extremities, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging all his Endeavours and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for their deliverance out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and never giving over his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours till he effected what was poſſible for their good and ſafety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was conſtant to his Mode and Faſhion of Life; he lived in the ſame Houſe, without any conſiderable alteration, kept the ſame Equipage, not withſtanding the encreaſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Fortune; the ſame Rules and Obſervances in his Houſhold, his Entertainments, his Houſe-keeping, <hi>pari faſtigio ſtetit in utraque For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He was conſtant to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; what he once was, he alwayes was; and what he once practiſed, he alwayes practiſed; he uſed the ſame moderation and equality, the ſame Juſtice and Integrity, the ſame qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and evenneſs of mind, the ſame Virtue and Goodneſs, the ſame Piety and Honour to his Parents, the ſame Humility and Affability,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93854:123"/>
the ſame Gravity and Decency, the ſame Compaſſion to the afflicted, the ſame Bounty and Liberality to all; and no variation of Succeſſes or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, no Diſlikes or Diſtaſtes of other men, no Hopes, no Fears, no perſwaſions, no ſiniſter Ends or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns conld ſhake him from his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or unſettle him from his <hi>Baſis</hi> of Honour or Virtue, upon which he ſtood fixed, ſquare and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And therefore when <hi>Anthony</hi> was in his loweſt condition, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Enemy to the State. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> in the vogue and eſteem in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeemed to ride upon the ſtrength of the Common breath of popular applauſe, and yet in this condition of Affairs, <hi>Atticus</hi> aſſiſted and protected the Family of <hi>Anthony</hi> with his Money and Intereſt in their loweſt and deplorable condition: And when the great men of the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look ſowr upon him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>quod parum odiſſe malos Cives Videretur:</hi> That he was too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the publick Enemies of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93854:123"/>
State, yet he continued conſtant in his way, and as our Author tells us, rather thought it his honour for him to practice what was fit for him to do, than what others would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>And certainly this Conſtancy of <hi>Atticus</hi> to his Friends, to Himſelf, to his Principles, was not only his Honour but his Safety; all the World looking upon him as a common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor to Humane Nature, not changed nor ſhaken from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by any variety of Fortune. A man that is unſtable or tottering is loved by no man, becauſe he is not fit to be truſted; but a man conſtant to worthy and generous Principles retains the like conſtancy of Eſteem and Veneration from all men, and together with his honour and eſteem and worth, commonly retains his ſafety and ſecurity in publick concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gathered out of the Hiſtory of the Life of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> ſuch things as ſeemed to me
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93854:124"/>
the great means of his unexampled peace, ſafety, honour, tranquillity and happineſs in a continued <hi>ſeries</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable and matchleſs concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſtorms in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, I ſhall conclude with theſe few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Obſervations upon his Life, and with ſome Cautions touching it. The Obſervations are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That moſt certainly Virtue, Goodneſs, and Integrity is the beſt Policy and greateſt means of Safety in the moſt dangerous times and places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That moſt certainly Virtue and Goodneſs and Integrity is the trueſt way for any man to gain true honour, veneration, and eſteem among men; it is more conducible than Riches, and Armies, and Triumphs, and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That as it is the trueſt way to get Honour, ſo it is the beſt means to keep it, becauſe ſuch an Honour hath not its dependence upon any thing without a man; his Fortune, Wealth, Power, or Succeſs, theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93854:124"/>
are changeable and variable; but a good, wiſe, and virtuous man carries the root and ſpring of his Honour in himſelf, he ſhall never ceaſe to be honoured till he ceaſe to be good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is a ſecret veneration of Goodneſs and Virtue in all men, even in the worſt and vileſt; a man cannot ſo far put off Humanity, but that Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Virtue will have ſo much of party and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his nature, that he cannot chooſe but pay a ſecret approbation, veneration, and eſteem to thoſe that have it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That conſequently Wiſdom, Beneficence, Virtue, and Goodneſs have a great connaturality to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and are the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Spirit or <hi>Genius</hi> of it, and that it is ſo, is evident, 1. By the great good it procures to Humane Nature, Honour, and Safety; and 2. By the great eſteem that Mankind hath of it, and the common intereſt it obtains in the common Nature of Mankind.</p>

Enemy, or a Traytor, proſcribed or baniſhed, ordinarily common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all States allows of relief and ſupport to his Wife, Children, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, Servants and dependents, but for the moſt part (if not always) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſupplies to be ſent to the perſon thus proſcribed, or declared an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or any communication or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him; becauſe though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be all done upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal account, and <hi>intuitu perſonae,</hi> without reſpect to his condition in relation to the Publick; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but be a ſupport to him, and a countenance of him, whereby he may be enabled to gather new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, or at leaſt courage or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for farther attemps to the promoting of his Faction, Party, or Deſigns. And although in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State thoſe declarations of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whether <hi>Marcus,</hi> or <hi>Sylla,</hi> or <hi>Brutus,</hi> or <hi>Anthony,</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> were obtained by the prevalence and ſollicitation of the adverſe Party or Faction, and were in a manner
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93854:126"/>
extracted from the Senate and People; yet it is plain, that according to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the ſupreme Authority was lodged in the Senate, or Senate and People; and therefore the publick Acts, Decrees, or Laws made by them were in force till repealed by the like Solemnity or Authority, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance at firſt unduly obtained. For ſuch veneration is neceſſarily due to Laws or Conſtitutions enacted by the full, ſupreme, legiſlative, legal power, according to the true Conſtitution of the Civil Government, that they are not to be reſcinded by private perſons, upon their pretence of being unduly obtained, till they are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly avoided by the like legal power by which they were enacted or inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
               <p>And therefore a private perſon (ſuch as <hi>Atticus</hi> was, or any other might be) that ſhould go about to relieve and ſupply <hi>Marius</hi> or <hi>Sylla, Pompey</hi> or <hi>Julius Caeſar, Brutus</hi> or <hi>Anthony, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> or <hi>Lepidus</hi> while they were under
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93854:126"/>
theſe publick Declarations or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions by the Civil Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, according to the ſettled Laws of that State, muſt needs be under a violation of the Law, and ſubjected to the danger and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that ariſeth from violations of publick Laws. Beſides, it may ſeem this liberty taken by <hi>Atticus</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving perſons thus declared Enemies to the Commonwealth, and holding ſuch intimate correſpondence with them, neither became a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen nor a good Man, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the old ſtandard of the <hi>Roman</hi> Morals, was,
<q>
                     <p>Qui conſult a patrum, qui leges juráque ſervat.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore though the general Scheme of the Life of <hi>Atticus</hi> afford a prudent and good Example of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, eſpecially in the like ſtate of Affairs, yet it were hard to make him a pattern of imitation in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of his ſupplies of Enemies, ſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93854:127"/>
publickly declared by the true ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, (I ſay the true ſupreme power of the <hi>Roman</hi> State) nor in his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them. For it is ſo far from proving a man's ſafety, that, according to the uſual Methods and Laws of Government, it expoſeth a man to the greateſt danger, and that even by the Law it ſelf.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Atticus</hi> therefore did in this kind, is ſingular and ſcarce compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to another perſon, becauſe it is hardly poſſible that any other perſon could be under the ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with <hi>Atticus</hi> when he uſed this practice, and therefore that which he did in this kind with ſafety, yea and honour to himſelf, may not be ventured upon by any perſon that ſtands otherwiſe circumſtantiated, and ſtudies his ſafety.</p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Roman</hi> State were ſevere enough in prohibiting ſupplies to their foreign Enemies, or holding correſpondence, or <hi>clandeſtina cum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus colloquia,</hi> yea and had and uſed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93854:127"/>
the like ſtrictneſs in relation to thoſe Mutinies, or Conſpiracies, or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions immediately or directly levelled againſt the State or Commonwealth it ſelf; as in the Conjuration of <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> their <hi>Bella ſervilia</hi> with their Slaves, and the like; yet it ſhould ſeem at this time they had not that ſtrict animad verſion againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Parties or Factions, which though they were bitter and cruel one towards another, yet they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a common love and care of the Commonwealth or Government cloſely, and each party poſſibly at ſome times might really intend the proſperity and advancement thereof, though the means whereby they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it proved pernicious to that end.</p>
               <p>2. Again and principally, although by the power and induſtry of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faction the Senate and People were oftentimes brought to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them with a Decree or Law in their favour, and with a Proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or Declaration to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93854:128"/>
of the adverſe party, yet every body knew that it was but a kind of forced compliance by the true Body of the Senate or People, and that the concern lay meerly between the parties litigant, and not ſo much in the true <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which would have been glad to have been free from both the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, or at leaſt from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition: And therefore the animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions and ſeverities uſed againſt either Party, though they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes great and cruel, yet were not ſo much from the temper of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, as from the diſtemper, jealouſie, animoſity and hatred between the contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves: and therefore they that ſuffered, looked upon their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings not as ſo much the exertions of the Juſtice of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, as the violence of the prevailing party.</p>
               <p>3. Again, the various ſucceſſes that thoſe Factions and their Heads and Parties had in the common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93854:128"/>
and in their ſucceſſes, ſeemed by degrees to make men ſenſible, that a good man and beneficent was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be protected, becauſe no party knew whether it might not ſhortly be his turn to make uſe of his beneficence: So that a man not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to either Faction as a party in it, was by a kind of tacit compact free from animad verſion or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his aſſiſtance to the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and was ſpared in theſe publick Concuſſions, as Temples or Sacred places are in time of publick Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>4. But again, <hi>Atticus</hi> had given in the whole courſe of his Life moſt certain and infallible indications that he did not, would not engage in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party or Faction, and that he did with an equal indifferency ſupply the neceſſities, and endeavour to remove the calamities of any of what Party ſoever he was; and bare a fair and equal reſpect to all of what Party ſoever, whether of the Party of <hi>Marius</hi> or <hi>Sylla,</hi> of <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:93854:129"/>
of <hi>Brutus</hi> or <hi>Anthony;</hi> by all which all men concluded him to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friend to Mankind; but no fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter, or encourager, or maintainer of any Faction. And it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any other man to have all theſe happy circumſtances to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to that common good opinion that all Parties, yea all men had of <hi>Atticus;</hi> whereby it came to paſs that theſe ſupplies and correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he held with the ſeveral engaged Parties, never brought him into the danger or ſuſpicion of being a promoter or favourer of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or to render thoſe his acts of Humanity any way unſafe or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to him.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſince the danger that might befall <hi>Atticus</hi> in his relief of thoſe that were declared Enemies to the Commonwealth, muſt neceſſarily ariſe either from the reſentment of the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in relieving thoſe they had declared Enemies, or from the jealouſie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and animoſity of that Party
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93854:129"/>
or Faction that then obtained, and might be offended at his kindneſs to an adverſe Party: He was in both theſe reſpects under a competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſecurity, not with ſtanding thoſe ſupplies and correſpondencies: For the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> though by the force of a prevailing Party they were drawn to, or rather driven to make Decrees and Declarations in their favour, and againſt the other Party; yet in truth they really diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked both, and would have been glad to be at quiet; and therefore were not over-eager, or buſie, or fierce in proſecuting thoſe that were bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to either Party, eſpecially if he were no Friend to the Faction it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, the Factions themſelves were not over-violent in their animadverſions upon <hi>Atticus</hi> his Beneficence to either Party, becauſe it was apparent he did it not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation or favour of a Faction, but as a common Benefactor to men in want and extremity: And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93854:130"/>
both he eſcaped thoſe ſeverities which poſſibly the rigour of the Law might have inflicted upon an aſſiſtant to a declared Enemy, or the jealouſie of a prevailing Party might have brought upon him.</p>
               <p>5. Again, he was a man of that great and deſerved reputation for his Prudence, Learning, Worth, Love to his Countrey, Liberality, Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Sincerity, that he had a high veneration with all men of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Factions; every man thought it a kind of barbarouſneſs and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to accuſe or injure ſuch a perſon eſpecially that had ſo obliged all Mankind. When a bold Tribune did accuſe <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> that great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain, he anſwered his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation with no other language, but led the People up to the Capitol and other places where the Monuments of his Triumphs and Benefits to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State gave them the freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Merits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Accuſation vaniſhed, and the Accuſer ſlunk away aſhamed of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93854:130"/>
his Attempt. But in all the whole Life of <hi>Atticus</hi> we find not ſo much as any Accuſation of him, no not to the Heads themſelves of the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parties. He was ſo much above Cenſure, that he never ſo much as fell under any Accuſations; which poſſibly may be a priviledge that few men living in publick Concuſſions, and of any eminence, are capable of.</p>
               <p>And therefore as this Example of the Liberality of <hi>Atticus</hi> to parties obnoxious to a publick declaration of being Enemies to the State, and his familiarity, intimacy, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with them may be a ſignal evidence of his Wiſdom, yea and alſo of his fortunate ſucceſs under ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Adventures; yet it cannot be allowed to be a common Example to other perſons to run the like hazard, becauſe it is morally impoſſible they ſhould be under ſuch happy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial circumſtances in this kind as <hi>Atticus</hi> was, and therefore cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like ſucceſs therein as he ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:93854:131"/>
Indeed if the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> that made theſe Decrees in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe that got into the Saddle, had been but Uſurpers of the ſupreme Authority, or had it not been really and legally fixed in them, or had they been a pack of men that had but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſupreme Authority, and the State-power of making Laws or politick Edicts, Proſcriptions, and Declarations of this nature, without any legal and true power ſo to do: It had not only been an act of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and generoſity, but poſſibly of duty, to have miniſtred relief and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to thoſe that were oppreſſed by them. But the Caſe was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; the true ſupreme Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> State was engaged in thoſe Edicts and Proſcriptions, though drawn thereunto by the power of a prevailing Party. And therefore the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of <hi>Atticus</hi> was great in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſupplies to thoſe that fell under thoſe Sentences and Decrees, though his great Wiſdom in managing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the great and publick veneration
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93854:131"/>
of his goodneſs, and the junctures of the affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, rendred him ſafe and ſecure from danger under that adventure. And whoſoever ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in like manner, had need be ſure his Circumſtances be the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and that he hath as good a Judgment, yea, and Fortune alſo, to diſcern and weather Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as he had, otherwiſe in ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures he cannot be without great danger.</p>
               <p>And as I have added this Caution touching the practice of <hi>Atticus,</hi> in his Life, ſo there is another Caution to be added touching his Deportment near his Death. It ſeems to me, that his obſtinate reſolution not to take any nouriſhment to preſerve his Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would prolong his pain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Life, was not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but as it ſavoured too much of impatience, unbecoming a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, ſo it was an act of much wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imprudence; for the receiving of convenient nouriſhment, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his Life, and poſſibly abate his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93854:132"/>
pain. But the wilful refuſal of it muſt neceſſarily be (as it was) an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of his Death, which he thereby haſtened; and although ſelf-Murder was grown too much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion among ſome of the Grandees of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the inſtance of <hi>Cato</hi> and others; yet certainly it was a practice not only of Inhumanity, but of much Puſillanimity and Impotence of Mind, and a miſerably miſtaken choice, to chooſe Death, the worſt of Evils, rather than endure Pain or Diſgrace in the world; which a little Philoſophy would have taught them to bear with patience, rather than to avoid by deſtroying their own Lives.</p>

               <p>IT is true that the lawful Governors of a Kingdom or State, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſometimes uſe great ſeverities upon Rebels and Diſturbers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and this is neceſſary as well by way of juſt retribution of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, but principally for example, and ſo prevent others from the like Exorbitances, <hi>Ut Poena ad paucos, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad omnes:</hi> Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being as well the two great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that ſupport Government, as the two great Wheels that keep it in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and orderly Motion.</p>
               <p>But yet there is great Prudence and Moderation to be uſed therein, as well in reference to the kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the puniſhments, as in the
<pb facs="tcp:93854:134"/>
extent of them; for if they be too inhumane and barbarous, or be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the perſons that are Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (when the number of them poſſibly is very great) it may prove like Phyſick that is too ſtrong for the Bodies, and brings many times greater danger than the Diſeaſe it deſigns to cure.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe of thoſe Factions in <hi>Rome,</hi> was not like that of the Civil Magiſtrate in puniſhing Malefactors in a State; but it was the Paſſions and Animoſities of one Faction or Party againſt another, and therefore ſuch horrid and extenſive ſeverities that they uſed one againſt another, rendred their ſeverities and the extent of them, as unexcuſable, ſo in the event, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unſucceſsful to thoſe that uſed them; the reaſon above given.</p>
